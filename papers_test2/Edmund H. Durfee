Learning Nested Agent Models in an Information Economy

  We present our approach to the problem of how an agent, within an economicMulti-Agent System, can determine when it should behave strategically (i.e.learn and use models of other agents), and when it should act as a simpleprice-taker. We provide a framework for the incremental implementation ofmodeling capabilities in agents, and a description of the forms of knowledgerequired. The agents were implemented and different populations simulated inorder to learn more about their behavior and the merits of using and learningagent models. Our results show, among other lessons, how savvy buyers can avoidbeing ``cheated'' by sellers, how price volatility can be used toquantitatively predict the benefits of deeper models, and how specific types ofagent populations influence system behavior.

Predicting the expected behavior of agents that learn about agents: the  CLRI framework

  We describe a framework and equations used to model and predict the behaviorof multi-agent systems (MASs) with learning agents. A difference equation isused for calculating the progression of an agent's error in its decisionfunction, thereby telling us how the agent is expected to fare in the MAS. Theequation relies on parameters which capture the agent's learning abilities,such as its change rate, learning rate and retention rate, as well as relevantaspects of the MAS such as the impact that agents have on each other. Wevalidate the framework with experimental results using reinforcement learningagents in a market system, as well as with other experimental results gatheredfrom the AI literature. Finally, we use PAC-theory to show how to calculatebounds on the values of the learning parameters.

Plan Development using Local Probabilistic Models

  Approximate models of world state transitions are necessary when buildingplans for complex systems operating in dynamic environments. External eventprobabilities can depend on state feature values as well as time spent in thatparticular state. We assign temporally -dependent probability functions tostate transitions. These functions are used to locally compute stateprobabilities, which are then used to select highly probable goal paths andeliminate improbable states. This probabilistic model has been implemented inthe Cooperative Intelligent Real-time Control Architecture (CIRCA), whichcombines an AI planner with a separate real-time system such that plans aredeveloped, scheduled, and executed with real-time guarantees. We present flightsimulation tests that demonstrate how our probabilistic model may improve CIRCAperformance.

The Automated Mapping of Plans for Plan Recognition

  To coordinate with other agents in its environment, an agent needs models ofwhat the other agents are trying to do. When communication is impossible orexpensive, this information must be acquired indirectly via plan recognition.Typical approaches to plan recognition start with a specification of thepossible plans the other agents may be following, and develop specialtechniques for discriminating among the possibilities. Perhaps more desirablewould be a uniform procedure for mapping plans to general structures supportinginference based on uncertain and incomplete observations. In this paper, wedescribe a set of methods for converting plans represented in a flexibleprocedural language to observation models represented as probabilistic beliefnetworks.

Resource-Driven Mission-Phasing Techniques for Constrained Agents in  Stochastic Environments

  Because an agents resources dictate what actions it can possibly take, itshould plan which resources it holds over time carefully, considering itsinherent limitations (such as power or payload restrictions), the competingneeds of other agents for the same resources, and the stochastic nature of theenvironment. Such agents can, in general, achieve more of their objectives ifthey can use --- and even create --- opportunities to change which resourcesthey hold at various times. Driven by resource constraints, the agents couldbreak their overall missions into an optimal series of phases, optimallyreconfiguring their resources at each phase, and optimally using their assignedresources in each phase, given their knowledge of the stochastic environment.In this paper, we formally define and analyze this constrained, sequentialoptimization problem in both the single-agent and multi-agent contexts. Wepresent a family of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations ofthis problem that can optimally create phases (when phases are not predefined)accounting for costs and limitations in phase creation. Because ourformulations multaneously also find the optimal allocations of resources ateach phase and the optimal policies for using the allocated resources at eachphase, they exploit structure across these coupled problems. This allows themto find solutions significantly faster(orders of magnitude faster in largerproblems) than alternative solution techniques, as we demonstrate empirically.
