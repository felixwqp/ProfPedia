Exact Phase Transitions in Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems

  In this paper we propose a new type of random CSP model, called Model RB,
which is a revision to the standard Model B. It is proved that phase
transitions from a region where almost all problems are satisfiable to a region
where almost all problems are unsatisfiable do exist for Model RB as the number
of variables approaches infinity. Moreover, the critical values at which the
phase transitions occur are also known exactly. By relating the hardness of
Model RB to Model B, it is shown that there exist a lot of hard instances in
Model RB.
