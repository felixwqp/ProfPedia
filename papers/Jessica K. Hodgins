Semantic Understanding of Professional Soccer Commentaries

  This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of semantic parsing via
learning the correspondences between complex sentences and rich sets of events.
Our main intuition is that correct correspondences tend to occur more
frequently. Our model benefits from a discriminative notion of similarity to
learn the correspondence between sentence and an event and a ranking machinery
that scores the popularity of each correspondence. Our method can discover a
group of events (called macro-events) that best describes a sentence. We
evaluate our method on our novel dataset of professional soccer commentaries.
The empirical results show that our method significantly outperforms the
state-of-theart.
