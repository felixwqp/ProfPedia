  We prove the conjecture of Chen, Wang and Liu in [8] concerning how tocalculate the parameter values corresponding to all the singu- larities,including the infinitely near singularities, of rational planar curves from theSmith normal forms of certain Bezout resultant ma- trices derived frommu-bases.

New Geometrical Spectra of Linear Codes with Applications to Performance  Analysis

  In this paper, new enumerating functions for linear codes are defined,including the triangle enumerating function and the tetrahedron enumeratingfunction, both of which can be computed using a trellis-based algorithm overpolynomial rings. The computational complexity is dominated by the complexityof the trellis. In addition, we show that these new enumerating functions canbe used to improve existing performance bounds on the maximum likelihooddecoding.

Fast Estimation of Diffusion Tensors under Rician noise by the EM  algorithm

  This paper presents a fast computational method, the Expectation Maximizationalgorithm, for Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation in diffusion tensor imagingunder the Rice noise model. We further extend the ML framework to the maximum aposterior (MAP) estimation and describe the numerical similarities of both MLand MAP estimators. This novel method is implemented and applied using bothsynthetic and real data in a wide range of b amplitudes. The comparison withother popular methods are made in accuracy, methodology and computation.

  This paper proposes a digital amplitude-phase weighting array based a minimumvariance multi-frequency distortionless restriction (MVMFDR) to aviod thefrequency band signal distortion in digital beamformer and too short time delayline (TDL) requirement in analoge wideband TDL array.

Fast Impurity Solver for Dynamical Mean Field Theory based on second  order perturbation around the atomic limit

  An impurity solver for the dynamical mean field (DMFT) study of the Mottinsulators is proposed, which is based on the second order perturbation of thehybridization function. After carefully benchmarking it with Quantum MonteCarlo results on the anti-ferromagnetic phase of the Hubbard model, we concludethat this impurity solver can capture the main physical features in the strongcoupling regime and can be a very useful tool for the LDA+DMFT studies of theMott insulators with long range order.

Analytical Solution for the SU(2) Hedgehog Skyrmion and Static  Properties of Nucleons

  An analytical solution for symmetric Skyrmion was proposed for the SU(2)Skyrme model, which take the form of the hybrid form of a kink-like solutionand that given by the instanton method. The static properties of nucleons wasthen computed within the framework of collective quantization of the Skyrmemodel, with a good agreement with that given by the exact numeric solution. Thecomparisons with the previous results as well as the experimental values arealso given.

Vacuum induced Berry phases in single-mode Jaynes-Cummings models

  Motivated by the work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 220404 (2002)] for detecting thevacuum-induced Berry phases with two-mode Jaynes-Cummings models (JCMs), weshow here that, for a parameter-dependent single-mode JCM, certain atom-fieldstates also acquire the photon-number-dependent Berry phases after theparameter slowly changed and eventually returned to its initial value. Thisgeometric effect related to the field quantization still exists, even the filedis kept in its vacuum state. Specifically, a feasible Ramsey interferenceexperiment with cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system is designed todetect the vacuum-induced Berry phase.

Spin transfer torque on magnetic insulators

  Recent experimental and theoretical studies focus on spin-mediated heatcurrents at interfaces between normal metals and magnetic insulators. Weresolve conflicting estimates for the order of magnitude of the spin transfertorque by first-principles calculations. The spin mixing conductanceG^\uparrow\downarrow of the interface between silver and the insulatingferrimagnet Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) is dominated by its real part and of theorder of 10^14 \Omega^-1m^-2, i.e. close to the value for intermetallicinterface, which can be explained by a local spin model.

Long time dynamics of defocusing energy critical 3 + 1 dimensional wave  equation with potential in the radial case

  Using channel of energy inequalities developed by T.Duyckaerts, C.Kenig andF.Merle, we prove that, modulo a free radiation, any finite energy radialsolution to the defocusing energy critical wave equation with radial potentialin 3 + 1 dimensions converges to the set of steady states as time goes toinfinity. For generic potentials we prove there are only finitely many steadystates, and in this case modulo some free radiation the solution converges toone steady state as time goes to infinity.

A note on the number of coefficients of automorphic $L-$functions for  $GL_m$ with same signs

  Let $\pi$ be an irreducible unitary cuspidal representation of $GL_m({\BbbA}_{\Bbb Q})$ and $L(s,\,\pi)$ be the global $L-$function attached to $\pi$. If${\rm Re}(s)>1$, $L(s,\,\pi)$ has a Dirichlet series expression. When $\pi$ isself-contragradient, all the coefficients of Dirichlet series are real. In thisnote, we shall give non-trivial lower bounds for the number of positive andnegative coefficients respectively, which is an improvement on the recent workof Jianya Liu and Jie Wu.

Phase-dependent optical response properties in an optomechanical system  by coherently driving the mechanical resonator

  We explore theoretically the optical response properties in an optomechanicalsystem under electromagneti- cally induced transparency condition but with themechanical resonator being driven by an additional coherent field. In thisconfiguration, more complex quantum coherent and interference phenomena occur.In partic- ular, we find that the probe transmission spectra depend on thetotal phase of the applied fields. Our study also provides an efficient way tocontrol propagation of amplification.

Vanilla Lasso for sparse classification under single index models

  This paper study sparse classification problems. We show that undersingle-index models, vanilla Lasso could give good estimate of unknownparameters. With this result, we see that even if the model is not linear, andeven if the response is not continuous, we could still use vanilla Lasso totrain classifiers. Simulations confirm that vanilla Lasso could be used to geta good estimation when data are generated from a logistic regression model.

Possible hadronic molecular states composed of $S$-wave heavy-light  mesons

  We perform a systematical study of possible molecular states composed of the$S$ wave heavy light mesons, where the $S-D$ mixing and {$\eta-\eta^{\prime}$mixing} are explicitly included. Our calculation indicates that the observed$X(3872)$ could be a loosely shallow molecular state composed of $D\bar{D}^\ast+h.c$, while neither $Z_c(3900)/Z_c(4020)$ nor $Z_b(10610)/Z_b(10650)$ issupported to be a molecule. Some observed possible molecular states arepredicted, which could be searched for by further experimental measurements.

Ultra-cold Collisions between Spin-Orbit-Coupled Dipoles: General  Formalism and Universality

  A theoretical study of the low-energy scattering properties of two alignedidentical bosonic and fermionic dipoles in the presence of isotropic spin-orbitcoupling (SOC) is presented. A general treatment of particles with arbitrary(pseudo-) spin is given in the framework of multi-channel scattering. Atultracold temperatures and away from shape resonances or closed-channeldominated resonances, the cross-section can be well described within the Bornapproximation to within corrections due to the s-wave scattering. We compareour findings with numerical calculations and find excellent agreement.

Emergent Quantum Dynamics of Vortex Line under Linear Local Induction  Approximation

  Using the linear local induction approximation, we investigated theself-induced motion of a vortex line that corresponds to the motion of aparticle in quantum mechanics. Concerning Kelvin waves, the effectiveSchr\"odinger equation, physical quantities operators, and the correspondingpath-integral formula are obtained. The vortex line-particle mapping may helpin understanding particle motion in quantum mechanics.

Bottom-quark Forward-Backward Asymmetry, Dark Matter and the LHC

  The LEP experiment at CERN provided accurate measurements of the $Z$ neutralgauge boson properties. Although all measurements agree well with the SMpredictions, the forward backward asymmetry of the bottom-quark remains almost3$\sigma$ away from the SM value. We proposed that this anomaly may beexplained by the existence of a new $U(1)_D$ gauge boson, which couples withopposite charges to the right-handed components of the bottom and charm quarks.Cancellation of gauge anomalies demands the presence of a vector-like singletcharged lepton as well as a neutral Dirac (or Majorana) particle that providesa Dark Matter candidate. Constraints from precision measurements imply that themass of the new gauge boson should be around $115$~GeV. We discuss theexperimental constraints on this scenario, including the existence of a di-jetresonance excess at an invariant mass similar to the mass of this new gaugeboson, observed in boosted topologies at the CMS experiment.

  The HQET sum rule analysis for the \Lambda_b matrix element of the four-quarkoperator relevant to its lifetime is reported. Our main conclusion is that thelifetime ratio \tau(\Lambda_b)/\tau(B^0) can be as low as 0.91.

Quantum Private Comparison: A Review

  As an important branch of quantum secure multiparty computation, quantumprivate comparison (QPC) has attracted more and more attention recently. Inthis paper, according to the quantum implementation mechanism that theseprotocols used, we divide these protocols into three categories: The quantumcryptography QPC, the superdense coding QPC, and the entanglement swapping QPC.And then, a more in-depth analysis on the research progress, design idea, andsubstantive characteristics of corresponding QPC categories is carried out,respectively. Finally, the applications of QPC and quantum secure multi-partycomputation issues are discussed and, in addition, three possible researchmainstream directions are pointed out.

Large Margin Softmax Loss for Speaker Verification

  In neural network based speaker verification, speaker embedding is expectedto be discriminative between speakers while the intra-speaker distance shouldremain small. A variety of loss functions have been proposed to achieve thisgoal. In this paper, we investigate the large margin softmax loss withdifferent configurations in speaker verification. Ring loss and minimumhyperspherical energy criterion are introduced to further improve theperformance. Results on VoxCeleb show that our best system outperforms thebaseline approach by 15\% in EER, and by 13\%, 33\% in minDCF08 and minDCF10,respectively.

Sub-barrier fusion of 32S+90,96Zr: semi-classical coupled-channels  approach

  The fusion excitation functions have been measured with rather good accuracyfor 32S+90Zr and 32S+96Zr near and below the Coulomb barrier. The sub-barriercross sections for 32S+96Zr are much larger compared with 32S+90Zr.Semi-classical coupled-channels calculations including two-phonon excitationsare capable to describe sub-barrier enhancement only for 32S+90Zr. Theremaining disagreement for 32S+96Zr comes from the positive Q-valueintermediate neutron transfers in this system. The comparison with 40Ca+96Zrsuggests that couplings to the positive Q-value neutron transfer channels mayplay a role in the sub-barrier fusion enhancement. A rather simple modelcalculation taking neutron transfers into account is proposed to overcome thediscrepancies of 32S+96Zr.

New classes of quadratic bent functions in polynomial forms

  In this paper, we propose a new construction of quadratic bent functions inpolynomial forms. Right Euclid algorithm in skew-polynomial rings over finitefields of characteristic 2 is applied in the proof.

Electromagnetic fingerprints of the Little Bang

  Measurements of thermal photons emitted from the rapidly expanding hot anddense medium ("Little Bang") formed in ultra relativistic heavy-ion collisions,and their current theoretical interpretation, are reviewed.

Conjugate Gradient Projection Approach for Multi-Antenna Gaussian  Broadcast Channels

  It has been shown recently that the dirty-paper coding is the optimalstrategy for maximizing the sum rate of multiple-input multiple-output Gaussianbroadcast channels (MIMO BC). Moreover, by the channel duality, the nonconvexMIMO BC sum rate problem can be transformed to the convex dual MIMOmultiple-access channel (MIMO MAC) problem with a sum power constraint. In thispaper, we design an efficient algorithm based on conjugate gradient projection(CGP) to solve the MIMO BC maximum sum rate problem. Our proposed CGP algorithmsolves the dual sum power MAC problem by utilizing the powerful concept ofHessian conjugacy. We also develop a rigorous algorithm to solve the projectionproblem. We show that CGP enjoys provable convergence, nice scalability, andgreat efficiency for large MIMO BC systems.

Maximum Weighted Sum Rate of Multi-Antenna Broadcast Channels

  Recently, researchers showed that dirty paper coding (DPC) is the optimaltransmission strategy for multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channels(MIMO-BC). In this paper, we study how to determine the maximum weighted sum ofDPC rates through solving the maximum weighted sum rate problem of the dualMIMO multiple access channel (MIMO-MAC) with a sum power constraint. We firstsimplify the maximum weighted sum rate problem such that enumerating allpossible decoding orders in the dual MIMO-MAC is unnecessary. We then design anefficient algorithm based on conjugate gradient projection (CGP) to solve themaximum weighted sum rate problem. Our proposed CGP method utilizes thepowerful concept of Hessian conjugacy. We also develop a rigorous algorithm tosolve the projection problem. We show that CGP enjoys provable convergence,nice scalability, and great efficiency for large MIMO-BC systems.

Prospects for Detecting Neutrino Signals from Annihilating/Decaying Dark  Matter to Account for the PAMELA and ATIC results

  Recent PAMELA data show that positron fraction has an excess above severalGeV while anti-proton one is not. Moreover ATIC data indicates thatelectron/positron flux have a bump from 300 GeV to 800 GeV. Both annihilatingdark matter (DM) with large boost factor and decaying DM with the life around $10^{26} s$ can account for the PAMELA and ATIC observations if their main finalproducts are charged leptons ($e$, $\mu$ and $\tau$). In this work, wecalculated the neutrino flux arising from $\mu$ and $\tau$ which originate fromannihilating/decaying DM, and estimated the final muon rate in the neutrinotelescopes, namely Antares and IceCube. Given the excellent angular resolution,Antares and IceCube are promising to discover the neutrino signals fromGalactic center and/or large DM subhalo in annihilating DM scenario, but verychallenging in decaying DM scenario.

Dark Matter as a Possible New Energy Source for Future Rocket Technology

  Current rocket technology can not send the spaceship very far, because theamount of the chemical fuel it can take is limited. We try to use dark matter(DM) as fuel to solve this problem. In this work, we give an example of DMengine using dark matter annihilation products as propulsion. The accelerationis proportional to the velocity, which makes the velocity increaseexponentially with time in non-relativistic region. The important points forthe acceleration are how dense is the DM density and how large is thesaturation region. The parameters of the spaceship may also have greatinfluence on the results. We show that the (sub)halos can accelerate thespaceship to velocity $ 10^{- 5} c \sim 10^{- 3} c$. Moreover, in case there isa central black hole in the halo, like the galactic center, the radius of thedense spike can be large enough to accelerate the spaceship close to the speedof light.

On Parameterized Gallager's First Bounds for Binary Linear Codes over  AWGN Channels

  In this paper, nested Gallager regions with a single parameter is introducedto exploit Gallager's first bounding technique (GFBT). We present a necessaryand sufficient condition on the optimal parameter. We also present a sufficientcondition (with a simple geometrical explanation) under which the optimalparameter does not depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). With this generalframework, three existing upper bounds are revisited, including the tangentialbound (TB) of Berlekamp, the sphere bound (SB) of Herzberg and Poltyrev, andthe tangential-sphere bound (TSB) of Poltyrev. This paper also reveals that theSB of Herzberg and Poltyrev is equivalent to the SB of Kasami et al., which wasrarely cited in literature.

Throughput capacity of two-hop relay MANETs under finite buffers

  Since the seminal work of Grossglauser and Tse [1], the two-hop relayalgorithm and its variants have been attractive for mobile ad hoc networks(MANETs) due to their simplicity and efficiency. However, most literatureassumed an infinite buffer size for each node, which is obviously notapplicable to a realistic MANET. In this paper, we focus on the exactthroughput capacity study of two-hop relay MANETs under the practical finiterelay buffer scenario. The arrival process and departure process of the relayqueue are fully characterized, and an ergodic Markov chain-based framework isalso provided. With this framework, we obtain the limiting distribution of therelay queue and derive the throughput capacity under any relay buffer size.Extensive simulation results are provided to validate our theoretical frameworkand explore the relationship among the throughput capacity, the relay buffersize and the number of nodes.

LHC diphoton excess from colorful resonances

  Motivated by the possible diphoton excess around $750~\rm{GeV}$ observed byATLAS and CMS at $13~\rm{TeV}$, we consider a coloron model from $\rm{SU}(3)_1\times \rm{SU}(3)_2$ spontaneously breaking to the Standard Model$\rm{SU}(3)_C$. A colored massive vector boson is resonantly produced by $q\bar q $ in proton collision, followed by a colored scalar cascade decay. Thisprocess gives two photons and one jet in the final states. And the kinetic edgeof the two photons can be an interpretation of the diphoton excess, whilesatisfying the dijet, $\rm{t}\bar{t}$, jet+photon resonance constraints. Inthis model, due to the large mass of vector resonance, the parton luminosityfunction ratio between $13~\rm{TeV}$ and $8~\rm{TeV}$ can be quite large.Therefore, the diphoton excess has not been observed at $8~\rm{TeV}$ search. Onthe other hand, having all the new particles color-charged around $\rm{TeV}$,this model predicts new signals at the LHC, which can be validated soon.

A Tale of Two Portals: Testing Light, Hidden New Physics at Future $e^+  e^-$ Colliders

  We investigate the prospects for producing new, light, hidden states at afuture $e^+ e^-$ collider in a Higgsed dark $U(1)_D$ model, which we call theDouble Dark Portal model. The simultaneous presence of both vector and scalarportal couplings immediately modifies the Standard Model Higgsstrahlungchannel, $e^+ e^- \to Zh$, at leading order in each coupling. In addition, eachportal leads to complementary signals which can be probed at direct andindirect detection dark matter experiments. After accounting for currentconstraints from LEP and LHC, we demonstrate that a future $e^+ e^-$ Higgsfactory will have unique and leading sensitivity to the two portal couplings bystudying a host of new production, decay, and radiative return processes.Besides the possibility of exotic Higgs decays, we highlight the importance ofdirect dark vector and dark scalar production at $e^+ e^-$ machines, whoseinvisible decays can be tagged from the recoil mass method.

Grid-side Flexibility of Power Systems in Integrating Large-scale  Renewable Generations: A Critical Review on Concepts, Formulations and  Solution Approaches

  Though considerable effort has been devoted to exploiting generation-side anddemand-side operational flexibility in order to cope with uncertain renewablegenerations, grid-side operational flexibility has not been fully investigated.In this review, we define grid-side flexibility as the ability of a powernetwork to deploy its flexibility resources to cope with the changes of powersystem state, particularly due to variation of renewable generation. Startingwith a survey on the metrics of operational flexibility, we explain thedefinition from both physical and mathematical point of views. Then conceptualexamples are presented to demonstrate the impacts of grid-side flexibilitygraphically, providing a geometric interpretation for a better understanding ofthe concepts. Afterwards the formulations and solution approaches in terms ofgrid-side flexibility in power system operation and planning are reviewed,based on which future research directions and challenges are outlined.

Bayesian model-based spatiotemporal survey design for log-Gaussian Cox  process

  In geostatistics, the design for data collection is central for accurateprediction and parameter inference. One important class of geostatisticalmodels is log-Gaussian Cox process (LGCP) which is used extensively, forexample, in ecology. However, there are no formal analyses on optimal designsfor LGCP models. In this work, we develop a novel model-based experimentaldesign for LGCP modeling of spatiotemporal point process data. We propose a newspatially balanced rejection sampling design which directs sampling tospatiotemporal locations that are a priori expected to provide mostinformation. We compare the rejection sampling design to traditional balancedand uniform random designs using the average predictive variance loss functionand the Kullback-Leibler divergence between prior and posterior for the LGCPintensity function. Our results show that the rejection sampling methodoutperforms the corresponding balanced and uniform random sampling designs forLGCP whereas the latter work better for models with Gaussian models. We performa case study applying our new sampling design to plan a survey for speciesdistribution modeling on larval areas of two commercially important fish stockson Finnish coastal areas. The case study results show that rejection samplingdesigns give considerable benefit compared to traditional designs. Results showalso that best performing designs may vary considerably between target species.

Constraining neutrino mass with tomographic weak lensing one-point  probability distribution function and power spectrum

  We study the constraints on neutrino mass sum (M_nu) from the one-pointprobability distribution function (PDF) and power spectrum of weak lensingmeasurements for an LSST-like survey, using the MassiveNuS simulations. The PDFprovides access to non-Gaussian information beyond the power spectrum. It isparticularly sensitive to nonlinear growth on small scales, where massiveneutrinos also have the largest effect. We find that tomography helps improvethe constraint on M_nu by 14% and 32% for the power spectrum and the PDF,respectively, compared to a single redshift bin. The PDF alone outperforms thepower spectrum in constraining M_nu. When the two statistics are combined, theconstraint is further tightened by 35%. We conclude that weak lensing PDF iscomplementary to the power spectrum and has the potential to become a powerfultool for constraining neutrino mass.

Nucleus Neural Network for Super Robust Learning

  Artificial neural networks which model the neurons and connectingarchitectures in brain have achieved great successes in many problems,especially those with deep layers. In this paper, we propose a nucleus neuralnetwork (NNN) and corresponding architecture and parameter learning methods. Ina nucleus, there are no regular layers, i.e., a neuron may connect to all theneurons in the nucleus. This architecture gets rid of layer limitation and maylead to more powerful learning capability. It is crucial to determine theconnections given numerous neurons. Based on the principle that more relevantinput and output neuron pair deserves higher connecting density, we propose anarchitecture learning model for the nucleus. Moreover, we propose an improvedlearning method for learning connecting weights and biases with the optimizedarchitecture. We find that this novel architecture is robust to irrelevantcomponents in test data. So we define a super robust learning problem and testthe proposed network with one case where the types of image backgrounds intraining and test sets are different. Experiments demonstrate that the proposedlearner achieves significant improvement over traditional learners on thereconstructed data set.

The littlest Higgs model with T-parity and single top production at $ep$  collision

  Based on calculating the contributions of the littlest Higgs model withT-parity (called $LHT$ model) to the anomalous top coupling $tq\gamma$ ($q=u$or $c$), we consider single top production via the t-channel partonic process$eq\to et$ at $ep$ collision. Our numerical results show that the productioncross section in the $LHT$ model can be significantly enhanced relative to thatin the standard model.

Scanning Tunneling Microscope Nanolithography on SrRuO3 Thin Film  Surfaces

  Nanoscale lithography on SrRuO3 (SRO) thin film surfaces has been performedby scanning tunneling microscopy under ambient conditions. The depth of etchedlines increases with increasing bias voltage but it does not changesignificantly by increasing the tunneling current. The dependence of line widthon bias voltage from experimental data is in agreement with theoreticalcalculation based on field-induced evaporation. Moreover, a three-squarenanostructure was successfully created, showing the capability of fabricatingnanodevices in SRO thin films.

The propagation of Elastic Waves in Granular Solid Hydrodynamics

  The anisotropic, stress-dependent velocity of elastic waves in glass beads --as observed by Y. Khidas and X. Jia, see [Phys. Rev. E, 81:021303, Feb. 2010]-- is shown to be well accounted for by ``granular solid hydrodynamics,'' abroad-range macroscopic theory of granular behavior. As the theory makes noreference to fabric anisotropy, the influence of which on sound is in doubt.

A note on eigenvalues and Hamiltoinan properties of $k$-connected graphs

  Let $\lambda_{1}(G)$ and $\mu_{1}(G)$ denote the spectral radius and theLaplacian spectral radius of a graph $G$, respectively. Li in [Electronic J.Linear Algebra 34 (2018) 389-392] proved sharp upper bounds of $\lambda_{1}(G)$based on the connectivity to assure a connected graph to be Hamiltonian andtraceable, respectively. In this paper, we present best possible upper boundsof $\lambda_{1}(G)$ for $k$-connected graphs to be Hamiltonian-connected andhomogeneously traceable, respectively. Furthermore, best possible upper boundsof $\mu_{1}(G)$ to predict $k$-connected graphs to be Hamiltonian-connected,Hamiltonian and traceable are originally proved, respectively.

Vertex-connectivity and $Q$-index of graphs with fixed girth

  Let $q(G)$ denote the $Q$-index of a graph $G$, which is the largest signlessLaplacian eigenvalue of $G$. We prove best possible upper bounds of $q(G)$ andbest possible lower bounds of $q(\overline{G})$ for a connected graph $G$ to be$k$-connected and maximally connected, respectively. Similar upper bounds of$q(G)$ and lower bounds of $q(\overline{G})$ to assure $G$ to besuper-connected are also obtained. Upper bounds of $q(G)$ and lower bounds of$q(\overline{G})$ to assure a connected triangle-free graph $G$ to be$k$-connected, maximally connected and super-connected are also respectivelyinvestigated.

Common Features in Electronic Structure of the Fe-Based Layered  Superconductors from Photoemission Spectroscopy

  High resolution photoemission measurements have been carried out onnon-superconducting LaOFeAs parent compound and various superconductingR(O1-xFx)FeAs (R=La, Ce and Pr) compounds. We found that the parent LaOFeAscompound shows a metallic character. Through extensive measurements, we haveidentified several common features in the electronic structure of theseFe-based compounds: (1). 0.2 eV feature in the valence band; (2). A universal13~16 meV feature; (3). A clear Fermi cutoff showing zero leading-edge shift inthe superconducting state;(4). Lack of superconducting coherence peak(s); (5).Near EF spectral weight suppression with decreasing temperature. Theseuniversal features can provide important information about band structure,superconducting gap and pseudogap in these Fe-based materials.

Growth, Characterization and Fermi Surface of Heavy Fermion CeCoIn5  Superconductor

  High quality single crystals of heavy Fermion CeCoIn5 superconductor havebeen grown by flux method with a typical size of (1~2)mm x (1~2)mm x ~0.1 mm.The single crystals are characterized by structural analysis from X-raydiffraction and Laue diffraction, as well as compositional analysis. Magneticand electrical measurements on the single crystals show a sharp superconductingtransition with a transition temperature at Tc(onset) ~ 2.3 K and a transitionwidth of ~0.15 K. The resistivity of the CeCoIn5 crystal exhibits a hump at ~45K which is typical of a heavy Fermion system. High resolution angle-resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of CeCoIn5 reveal clear Fermisurface sheets that are consistent with the band structure calculations whenassuming itinerant Ce 4f electrons at low temperature. This work providesimportant information on the electronic structure of heavy Fermion CeCoIn5superconductor. It also lays a foundation for further studies on the physicalproperties and superconducting mechanism of the heavy Fermion superconductors.

Topological Superconductor Bi2Te3/NbSe2 heterostructures

  Topological superconductors (TSCs) have a full gap in the bulk and gaplesssurface states consisting of Majorana fermions, which have potentialapplications in fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Because TSCsare very rare in nature, an alternative way to study the TSC is to artificiallyintroduce superconductivity into the surface states of a topological insulator(TI) through proximity effect (PE)1-4. Here we report the first experimentalrealization of the PE induced TSC in Bi2Te3/NbSe2 thin films as demonstrated bythe density of states probed using scanning tunneling microscope. We observeAbrikosov vortices and lower energy bound states on the surface of topologicalinsulator and the dependence of superconducting coherence length on the filmthickness and magnetic field, which are attributed to the superconductivity inthe topological surface states. This work demonstrates the practicalfeasibility of fabricating a TSC with individual Majorana fermions insidesuperconducting vortex as predicted in theory and accomplishes thepre-requisite step towards searching for Majorana fermions in the PE inducedTSCs.

Majorana mode in vortex core of Bi2Te3/NbSe2 topological  insulator-superconductor heterostructure

  Majorana fermions have been intensively studied in recent years for theirimportance to both fundamental science and potential applications intopological quantum computing1,2. Majorana fermions are predicted to exist in avortex core of superconducting topological insulators3. However, they areextremely difficult to be distinguished experimentally from other quasiparticlestates for the tiny energy difference between Majorana fermions and thesestates, which is beyond the energy resolution of most available techniques.Here, we overcome the problem by systematically investigating the spatialprofile of the Majorana mode and the bound quasiparticle states within a vortexin Bi2Te3/NbSe2. While the zero bias peak in local conductance splits right offthe vortex center in conventional superconductors, it splits off at a finitedistance ~20nm away from the vortex center in Bi2Te3/NbSe2, primarily due tothe Majorana fermion zero mode. While the Majorana mode is destroyed byreducing the distance between vortices, the zero bias peak splits as aconventional superconductor again. This work provides strong evidences ofMajorana fermions and also suggests a possible route to manipulating them.

Superconductivity in single-layer films of FeSe with a transition  temperature above 100 K

  Recently, interface has been employed to enhance superconductivity in thesingle-layer FeSe films grown on SrTiO3(001)(STO) with a possible Tc of ~ 80 K,which is nearly ten times of the Tc of bulk FeSe and is above the Tc record of56 K for the bulk Fe-based superconductors. This work together with those onsuperconducting oxides interfaces revives the long-standing idea that electronpairing at a two-dimensional (2D) interface between two different materials isa potential path to high transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity.Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurementsrevealed different electronic structure from those of bulk FeSe with asuperconducting-like energy gap closing at around 65K. However, previous exsitu electrical transport measurements could only detect the zero-resistancebelow ~30 K. Here we report the observation of high Tc superconductivity in theFeSe/STO system. By in situ 4-point probe (4PP) electrical transportmeasurement that can be conducted at an arbitrary position of the FeSe film onSTO, we detected superconductivity above 100 K. Our finding makes FeSe/STO theexciting and ideal research platform for higher Tc superconductivity.

Superconducting Gap and Pseudogap in Sm(O$_{1-x}$F$_x$)FeAs Layered  Superconductor from Photoemission Spectroscopy

  High resolution photoemission measurements have been carried out onnon-superconducting SmOFeAs parent compound and superconductingSm(O$_{1-x}$F$_x$)FeAs (x=0.12, and 0.15) compounds. The momentum-integratedspectra exhibit a clear Fermi cutoff that shows little leading-edge shift inthe superconducting state which suggests the Fermi surface sheet(s) around the$\Gamma$ point may not be gapped in this multiband superconductors. A robustfeature at 13 meV is identified in all these samples. Spectral weightsuppression near E$_F$ with decreasing temperature is observed in both undopedand doped samples that points to a possible existence of a pseudogap in theseFe-based compounds.

Exploring a Unified Attention-Based Pooling Framework for Speaker  Verification

  The pooling layer is an essential component in the neural network basedspeaker verification. Most of the current networks in speaker verification useaverage pooling to derive the utterance-level speaker representations. Averagepooling takes every frame as equally important, which is suboptimal since thespeaker-discriminant power is different between speech segments. In this paper,we present a unified attention-based pooling framework and combine it with themulti-head attention. Experiments on the Fisher and NIST SRE 2010 dataset showthat involving outputs from lower layers to compute the attention weights canoutperform average pooling and achieve better results than vanilla attentionmethod. The multi-head attention further improves the performance.

A $\pmbν$ Solution to the Strong CP Problem

  We present a new solution to the strong CP problem in which the imaginarycomponent of the up quark mass, $\mathcal{I}[m_u]$, acquires a tiny, butnon-vanishing value. This is achieved via a Dirac seesaw mechanism, which isalso responsible for the generation of the small neutrino masses. Consistencywith the observed value of the up quark mass is achieved via instantoncontributions arising from QCD-like interactions. In this framework, the valueof the neutron electric dipole moment is directly related to$\mathcal{I}[m_u]$, which, due to its common origin with the neutrino masses,implies that the neutron electric dipole moment is likely to be measured in thenext round of experiments. We also present a supersymmetric extension of thisDirac seesaw model to stabilize the hierarchy among the scalar mass scalesinvolved in this new mechanism.

Selective adsorption of first-row atoms on boron nitride nanotubes: the  effect of localized states

  First-principles calculations reveal that the adsorption of representativefirst-row atoms with different electronegativity, such as lithium (Li), carbon(C) and fluorine (F), on zigzag single-walled boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs)exhibits surprising selectivity. The adsorption energy and adsorption site aredependent upon the chemical activity of adsorbate with respect to the B and Natoms in the host tube. In detail, the F atom prefers to be adsorbed on the topof the B atom, the C atom is energetically favorable to stay on the bridge sitewhich is perpendicular to the tube-axis, and the Li atom hardly adheres to thetube (an endothermal reaction). The adsorption behavior of these three types ofelements on BNNTs is elucidated based on the frontier molecular orbital theory.In addition, the mechanism of modification of electronic structures of BNNTs byadsorption is probed, and a feasible approach is proposed to tailor theelectronic properties of BNNTs.

Boundary Feedback Control of Unstable Heat Equation with Space and Time  Dependent Coefficient

  In this paper, we study the control of the linear heat equation with a spaceand time dependent coefficient function by the Dirichlet and Neumann boundarycontrol laws. This equation models the heat diffusion and space, time dependentheat generation in a one dimensional rod. Without control, the system isunstable if the coefficient function is positive and large. With boundarycontrol based on the state feedback, we show that for the time analyticcoefficient $a(x,t)$, the exponential stability of the system at any rate canbe achieved. It is further shown that both the control of the Dirichlet andNeumann boundary value systems can be stabilized using this method. In doingthis, the control kernels are {\it explicitly} calculated as series ofapproximation and they are used in the simulations. The numerical simulationconfirmed the theoretical arguments and the controllability of the system. Thepossible future works are discussed at the end. This is the continuation of therecent work of Liu [{\it SIAM J. Cont. Optim.} vol. 42, pp. 1033-1043] andSmyshlyaev and Krstic [accepted by {\it Automatica}].
