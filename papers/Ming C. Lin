Probing Hamiltonian field redefinition on the nontrivial conformal
  algebra

  The compatibility between the conformal symmetry and the closure of conformal
algebras is discussed on the nonlinear sigma model. The present approach, above
the basis of field redefinition employed in the Hamiltonian scheme, attempts
the method of quantisation with intuitive picture. As a general field theoretic
treatment, the consistency is ensured by means of the interesting features
which are observed in the historical studies for the gauge-invariant conformal
symmetry. The identification of conformal anomaly is also shown coincident with
the conventional one approached within the path-integral formulation.


Critical gaps of first-order phase transition in infinitely long Ising
  cylinders with antiperiodically joined circumference

  Based on the analytic expression of free energy for infinitely long Ising
strip with finite width joined antiperiodically on a variety of planar
lattices, we show the existence of first-order phase transition at the critical
point of Ising transition. The critical gaps of the transition are also
calculated analytically by measuring the discontinuities in the internal energy
and the specific heat.


Exact treatment of Ising model on the helical tori

  The exact closed forms of the partition functions of 2D Ising model on square
lattices with twisted boundary conditions are given. The constructions of
helical tori are unambiguously related to the twisted boundary conditions by
virtue of the SL(2,Z) transforms. Numerical analyses reveal that the finite
size effect is irrelevant to the chirality equipped with each helical boundary
condition.


Partonic Effects in Heavy Ion Collisions at RHIC

  Effects of partonic interactions in heavy ion collisions at RHIC are studied
in a multiphase transport model (AMPT) that includes both initial partonic and
final hadronic interactions.It is found that a large parton scattering cross
section is needed to understand the measured elliptic flow of pions and
two-pion correlation function.


Optical control of azo-polymer film loaded surface plasmon- polariton
  wave

  An active control method of azo-polymer loaded surface plasmon-polaritons
(SPPs) wave with tightly focused 532nm laser is proposed and demonstrated in
this paper. Theoretical analysis and experimental results are consistent, which
confirm the validity of this method. The optically active control method has
the advantage of simple samples preparation, high spatial resolution and
selectively control of the SPPs wave. This optical control of SPPs wave method
has potential applications in integrated plasmonics.


Experimental Demonstration of 503.61-Gbit/s DMT over 10-km 7-Core Fiber
  with 1.5-μm SM-VCSEL for Optical Interconnects

  We experimentally demonstrate a net-rate 503.61-Gbit/s discrete multitone
(DMT) transmission over 10-km 7-core fiber with 1.5-\mu m single mode VCSEL,
where low-complexity kernelrecursive-least-squares algorithm is employed for
nonlinear channel equalization.


Measurement of photoelectron yield of the prototype for the CDEX-10
  liquid argon detector

  The China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) is a low background experiment at
China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL) designed to directly detect dark
matter with a high-purity Germanium (HPGe) detector. In the second phase
CDEX-10 with a 10 kg Germanium array detector system, the liquid argon (LAr)
anti-compton active shielding and cooling system is proposed. For purpose of
studying the properties of LAr detector, a prototype with an active volume of 7
liters of liquid argon was built and operated. The photoelectron yields, as a
critically important parameter for the prototype detector, have been measured
to be 0.051-0.079 p.e./keV for 662 keV Gamma lines at different positions. The
good agreement between the experimental and simulation results has provided a
quite reasonable understanding and determination of the important parameters
such as the Surviving Fraction of the Ar2 excimers, the absorption length for
128 nm photons in liquid argon, the reflectivity of Teflon and so on.


A Multi-Phase Transport Model for Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions

  We describe in detail how the different components of a multi-phase transport
(AMPT) model, that uses the Heavy Ion Jet Interaction Generator (HIJING) for
generating the initial conditions, Zhang's Parton Cascade (ZPC) for modeling
partonic scatterings, the Lund string fragmentation model or a quark
coalescence model for hadronization, and A Relativistic Transport (ART) model
for treating hadronic scatterings, are improved and combined to give a coherent
description of the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions. We also
explain the way parameters in the model are determined, and discuss the
sensitivity of predicted results to physical input in the model. Comparisons of
these results to experimental data, mainly from heavy ion collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), are then made in order to extract
information on the properties of the hot dense matter formed in these
collisions.


Finite-size scaling of partition function zeros and first-order phase
  transition for infinitely long Ising cylinder

  The critical properties of an infinitely long Ising strip with finite width L
joined periodically or antiperiodically are investigated by analyzing the
distribution of partition function zeros. For periodic boundary condition, the
the leading finite-size scaling of partition function zeros and its corrections
are given. For antiperiodic boundary condition, the critical point of 2D Ising
transition is one of the loci of the zeros, and the associated non-analyticity
is identified as a first-order phase transition. The exact amount of the latent
heat released by the transition is 4/L.


Deuteron production and elliptic flow in relativistic heavy ion
  collisions

  The hadronic transport model \textsc{art} is extended to include the
production and annihilation of deuterons via the reactions $BB \leftrightarrow
dM$, where $B$ and $M$ stand for baryons and mesons, respectively, as well as
their elastic scattering with mesons and baryons in the hadronic matter. This
new hadronic transport model is then used to study the transverse momentum
spectrum and elliptic flow of deuterons in relativistic heavy ion collisions,
with the initial hadron distributions after hadronization of produced
quark-gluon plasma taken from a blast wave model. The results are compared with
those measured by the PHENIX and STAR Collaborations for Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}^{}} = 200$ GeV, and also with those obtained from the coalescence
model based on freeze-out nucleons in the transport model.


Creation of Helical Dirac Fermions by Interfacing Two Gapped Systems of
  Ordinary Fermions

  Topological insulators (TIs) are a unique class of materials characterized by
a surface (edge) Dirac cone state of helical Dirac fermions in the middle of
bulk (surface) gap. When the thickness (width) of TIs is reduced, however,
interaction between the surface (edge) states will open a gap removing the
Dirac cone. Using density function theory calculation, we demonstrate the
creation of helical Dirac fermions from interfacing two gapped TI films, a
single bilayer Bi grown on a single quintuple layer Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3. The
theoretical prediction is directly confirmed by experiment. We further show
that the extrinsic helical Dirac fermions consists of predominantly Bi bilayer
states, which are created by a giant Rashba effect due to interfacial charge
transfer. Our findings provide a promising new method to create novel TI
materials by interface engineering.


Estimating Traffic Conditions At Metropolitan Scale Using Traffic Flow
  Theory

  The rapid urbanization and increasing traffic have serious social, economic,
and environmental impact on metropolitan areas worldwide. It is of a great
importance to understand the complex interplay of road networks and traffic
conditions. The authors propose a novel framework to estimate traffic
conditions at the metropolitan scale using GPS traces. Their approach begins
with an initial estimation of network travel times by solving a convex
optimization program based on traffic flow theory. Then, they iteratively
refine the estimated network travel times and vehicle traversed paths. Last,
the authors perform a bilevel optimization process to estimate traffic
conditions on road segments that are not covered by GPS data. The evaluation
and comparison of the authors' approach over two state-of-the-art methods show
up to 96.57% relative improvements. The authors have further conducted field
tests by coupling road networks of San Francisco and Beijing with real-world
GIS data, which involve 128,701 nodes, 148,899 road segments, and over 26
million GPS traces.


LSwarm: Efficient Collision Avoidance for Large Swarms with Coverage
  Constraints in Complex Urban Scenes

  In this paper, we address the problem of collision avoidance for a swarm of
UAVs used for continuous surveillance of an urban environment. Our method,
LSwarm, efficiently avoids collisions with static obstacles, dynamic obstacles
and other agents in 3-D urban environments while considering coverage
constraints. LSwarm computes collision avoiding velocities that (i) maximize
the conformity of an agent to an optimal path given by a global coverage
strategy and (ii) ensure sufficient resolution of the coverage data collected
by each agent. Our algorithm is formulated based on ORCA (Optimal Reciprocal
Collision Avoidance) and is scalable with respect to the size of the swarm. We
evaluate the coverage performance of LSwarm in realistic simulations of a swarm
of quadrotors in complex urban models. In practice, our approach can compute
collision avoiding velocities for a swarm composed of tens to hundreds of
agents in a few milliseconds on dense urban scenes consisting of tens of
buildings.


Quasiparticle Dynamics in Reshaped Helical Dirac Cone of Topological
  Insulators

  Topological insulators (TIs) and graphene present two unique classes of
materials which are characterized by spin polarized (helical) and non-polarized
Dirac-cone band structures, respectively. The importance of many-body
interactions that renormalize the linear bands near Dirac point in graphene has
been well recognized and attracted much recent attention. However,
renormalization of the helical Dirac point has not been observed in TIs. Here,
we report the experimental observation of the renormalized quasi-particle
spectrum with a skewed Dirac cone in a single Bi bilayer grown on Bi2Te3
substrate, from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. First-principles
band calculations indicate that the quasi-particle spectra are likely
associated with the hybridization between the extrinsic substrate-induced Dirac
states of Bi bilayer and the intrinsic surface Dirac states of Bi2Te3 film at
close energy proximity. Without such hybridization, only single-particle Dirac
spectra are observed in a single Bi bilayer grown on Bi2Se3, where the
extrinsic Dirac states Bi bilayer and the intrinsic Dirac states of Bi2Se3 are
well separated in energy. The possible origins of many-body interactions are
discussed. Our findings provide a means to manipulate topological surface
states.


Detailed Garment Recovery from a Single-View Image

  Most recent garment capturing techniques rely on acquiring multiple views of
clothing, which may not always be readily available, especially in the case of
pre-existing photographs from the web. As an alternative, we pro- pose a method
that is able to compute a rich and realistic 3D model of a human body and its
outfits from a single photograph with little human in- teraction. Our algorithm
is not only able to capture the global shape and geometry of the clothing, it
can also extract small but important details of cloth, such as occluded
wrinkles and folds. Unlike previous methods using full 3D information (i.e.
depth, multi-view images, or sampled 3D geom- etry), our approach achieves
detailed garment recovery from a single-view image by using statistical,
geometric, and physical priors and a combina- tion of parameter estimation,
semantic parsing, shape recovery, and physics- based cloth simulation. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by re-purposing the
reconstructed garments for virtual try-on and garment transfer applications, as
well as cloth animation for digital characters.


Low-mass dark matter search results from full exposure of PandaX-I
  experiment

  We report the results of a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark
matter search using the full 80.1\;live-day exposure of the first stage of the
PandaX experiment (PandaX-I) located in the China Jin-Ping Underground
Laboratory. The PandaX-I detector has been optimized for detecting low-mass
WIMPs, achieving a photon detection efficiency of 9.6\%. With a fiducial liquid
xenon target mass of 54.0\,kg, no significant excess event were found above the
expected background. A profile likelihood analysis confirms our earlier finding
that the PandaX-I data disfavor all positive low-mass WIMP signals reported in
the literature under standard assumptions. A stringent bound on the low mass
WIMP is set at WIMP mass below 10\,GeV/c$^2$, demonstrating that liquid xenon
detectors can be competitive for low-mass WIMP searches.


Plasmoid ejection and secondary current sheet generation from magnetic
  reconnection in laser-plasma interaction

  Reconnection of the self-generated magnetic fields in laser-plasma
interaction was first investigated experimentally by Nilson {\it et al.} [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 97, 255001 (2006)] by shining two laser pulses a distance apart on a
solid target layer. An elongated current sheet (CS) was observed in the plasma
between the two laser spots. In order to more closely model magnetotail
reconnection, here two side-by-side thin target layers, instead of a single
one, are used. It is found that at one end of the elongated CS a fan-like
electron outflow region including three well-collimated electron jets appears.
The ($>1$ MeV) tail of the jet energy distribution exhibits a power-law
scaling. The enhanced electron acceleration is attributed to the intense
inductive electric field in the narrow electron dominated reconnection region,
as well as additional acceleration as they are trapped inside the rapidly
moving plasmoid formed in and ejected from the CS. The ejection also induces a
secondary CS.


A novel artificial condensed matter lattice and a new platform for
  one-dimensional topological phases

  Engineered lattices in condensed matter physics, such as cold atom optical
lattices or photonic crystals, can have fundamentally different properties from
naturally-occurring electronic crystals. Here, we report a novel type of
artificial quantum matter lattice. Our lattice is a multilayer heterostructure
built from alternating thin films of topological and trivial insulators. Each
interface within the heterostructure hosts a set of topologically-protected
interface states, and by making the layers sufficiently thin, we demonstrate
for the first time a hybridization of interface states across layers. In this
way, our heterostructure forms an emergent atomic chain, where the interfaces
act as lattice sites and the interface states act as atomic orbitals, as seen
from our measurements by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). By
changing the composition of the heterostructure, we can directly control
hopping between lattice sites. We realize a topological and a trivial phase in
our superlattice band structure. We argue that the superlattice may be
characterized in a significant way by a one-dimensional topological invariant,
closely related to the invariant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Our
topological insulator heterostructure demonstrates a novel experimental
platform where we can engineer band structures by directly controlling how
electrons hop between lattice sites.


JINGLE, a JCMT legacy survey of dust and gas for galaxy evolution
  studies: I. Survey overview and first results

  JINGLE is a new JCMT legacy survey designed to systematically study the cold
interstellar medium of galaxies in the local Universe. As part of the survey we
perform 850um continuum measurements with SCUBA-2 for a representative sample
of 193 Herschel-selected galaxies with M*>10^9Msun, as well as integrated
CO(2-1) line fluxes with RxA3m for a subset of 90 of these galaxies. The sample
is selected from fields covered by the Herschel-ATLAS survey that are also
targeted by the MaNGA optical integral-field spectroscopic survey. The new JCMT
observations combined with the multi-wavelength ancillary data will allow for
the robust characterization of the properties of dust in the nearby Universe,
and the benchmarking of scaling relations between dust, gas, and global galaxy
properties. In this paper we give an overview of the survey objectives and
details about the sample selection and JCMT observations, present a consistent
30 band UV-to-FIR photometric catalog with derived properties, and introduce
the JINGLE Main Data Release (MDR). Science highlights include the
non-linearity of the relation between 850um luminosity and CO line luminosity,
and the serendipitous discovery of candidate z>6 galaxies.


Search for Baryon and Lepton Number Violation in
  $J/ψ\toΛ_c^+e^-+c.c.$

  Using $1.31\times10^9$ $J/\psi$ events collected by the BESIII detector at
the Beijing Electron Positron Collider, we search for the process
$J/\psi\to\Lambda_c^+e^-+c.c.$ for the first time. In this process, both baryon
and lepton number conservation is violated. No signal is found and the upper
limit on the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\to\Lambda_c^+e^-+c.c.)$ is
set to be $6.9\times10^{-8}$ at the 90\% Confidence Level.


Measurements of absolute branching fractions for $D$ mesons decays into
  two pseudoscalar mesons

  Using a data sample of $e^+e^-$ collision data with an integrated luminosity
of 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ taken at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt s= 3.773$~GeV with
the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage rings, we measure the
absolute branching fractions of the two-body hadronic decays $D^+\to
\pi^+\pi^0$, $K^+ \pi^0$, $\pi^+ \eta$, $K^+\eta$, $\pi^+\eta^\prime$,
$K^+\eta^\prime$, $K_S^0 \pi^+$, $K_S^0 K^+$, and $D^0\to \pi^+ \pi^-$, $K^+
K^-$, $K^\mp \pi^\pm$, $K_S^0 \pi^0$, $K_S^0 \eta$, $K_S^0 \eta^\prime$. Our
results are consistent with previous measurements within uncertainties. Among
them, the branching fractions for $D^+\to\pi^+\pi^0$, $K^+\pi^0$, $\pi^+\eta$,
$\pi^+\eta^\prime$, $K_S^0 \pi^+$, $K_S^0 K^+$ and $D^0 \to K_S^0 \pi^0$,
$K_S^0 \eta$, $K_S^0 \eta^\prime$ are determined with improved precision
compared to the world average values.

Dark Matter" held at University of Maryland on March 23-25, 2017.


First low frequency all-sky search for continuous gravitational wave
  signals

  In this paper we present the results of the first low frequency all-sky
search of continuous gravitational wave signals conducted on Virgo VSR2 and
VSR4 data. The search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 Hz and
128 Hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ Hz/s and $+1.5
\times 10^{-11}$ Hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. The starting
point was a set of short Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), of length 8192 seconds,
built from the calibrated strain data. Aggressive data cleaning, both in the
time and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much as
possible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. On each dataset a
number of candidates has been selected, using the FrequencyHough transform in
an incoherent step. Only coincident candidates among VSR2 and VSR4 have been
examined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the most
significant candidates have been selected. The criteria we have used for
candidate selection and for the coincidence step greatly reduce the harmful
effect of large instrumental artifacts. Selected candidates have been subject
to a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer FFTs followed by a further
incoherent analysis. No evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals was
found, therefore we have set a population-based joint VSR2-VSR4 90$\%$
confidence level upper limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain in
the frequency range between 20 Hz and 128 Hz. This is the first all-sky search
for continuous gravitational waves conducted at frequencies below 50 Hz. We set
upper limits in the range between about $10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ at
most frequencies. Our upper limits on signal strain show an improvement of up
to a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searches
at frequencies below $80~\mathrm{Hz}$.


A search of the Orion spur for continuous gravitational waves using a
  "loosely coherent" algorithm on data from LIGO interferometers

  We report results of a wideband search for periodic gravitational waves from
isolated neutron stars within the Orion spur towards both the inner and outer
regions of our Galaxy. As gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter,
the search is unimpeded by dust and concentrations of stars. One search disk
(A) is $6.87^\circ$ in diameter and centered on
$20^\textrm{h}10^\textrm{m}54.71^\textrm{s}+33^\circ33'25.29"$, and the other
(B) is $7.45^\circ$ in diameter and centered on
$8^\textrm{h}35^\textrm{m}20.61^\textrm{s}-46^\circ49'25.151"$. We explored the
frequency range of 50-1500 Hz and frequency derivative from $0$ to $-5\times
10^{-9}$ Hz/s. A multi-stage, loosely coherent search program allowed probing
more deeply than before in these two regions, while increasing coherence length
with every stage.
  Rigorous followup parameters have winnowed initial coincidence set to only 70
candidates, to be examined manually. None of those 70 candidates proved to be
consistent with an isolated gravitational wave emitter, and 95% confidence
level upper limits were placed on continuous-wave strain amplitudes. Near $169$
Hz we achieve our lowest 95% CL upper limit on worst-case linearly polarized
strain amplitude $h_0$ of $6.3\times 10^{-25}$, while at the high end of our
frequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of $3.4\times 10^{-24}$ for
all polarizations and sky locations.


Narrow-band search of continuous gravitational-wave signals from Crab
  and Vela pulsars in Virgo VSR4 data

  In this paper we present the results of a coherent narrow-band search for
continuous gravitational-wave signals from the Crab and Vela pulsars conducted
on Virgo VSR4 data. In order to take into account a possible small mismatch
between the gravitational wave frequency and two times the star rotation
frequency, inferred from measurement of the electromagnetic pulse rate, a range
of 0.02 Hz around two times the star rotational frequency has been searched for
both the pulsars. No evidence for a signal has been found and 95$\%$ confidence
level upper limits have been computed both assuming polarization parameters are
completely unknown and that they are known with some uncertainty, as derived
from X-ray observations of the pulsar wind torii. For Vela the upper limits are
comparable to the spin-down limit, computed assuming that all the observed
spin-down is due to the emission of gravitational waves. For Crab the upper
limits are about a factor of two below the spin-down limit, and represent a
significant improvement with respect to past analysis. This is the first time
the spin-down limit is significantly overcome in a narrow-band search.


A directed search for gravitational waves from Scorpius X-1 with initial
  LIGO

  We present results of a search for continuously-emitted gravitational
radiation, directed at the brightest low-mass X-ray binary, Scorpius X-1. Our
semi-coherent analysis covers 10 days of LIGO S5 data ranging from 50-550 Hz,
and performs an incoherent sum of coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic power
distributed amongst frequency-modulated orbital sidebands. All candidates not
removed at the veto stage were found to be consistent with noise at a 1% false
alarm rate. We present Bayesian 95% confidence upper limits on
gravitational-wave strain amplitude using two different prior distributions: a
standard one, with no a priori assumptions about the orientation of Scorpius
X-1; and an angle-restricted one, using a prior derived from electromagnetic
observations. Median strain upper limits of 1.3e-24 and 8e-25 are reported at
150 Hz for the standard and angle-restricted searches respectively. This proof
of principle analysis was limited to a short observation time by unknown
effects of accretion on the intrinsic spin frequency of the neutron star, but
improves upon previous upper limits by factors of ~1.4 for the standard, and
2.3 for the angle-restricted search at the sensitive region of the detector.


Searches for continuous gravitational waves from nine young supernova
  remnants

  We describe directed searches for continuous gravitational waves in data from
the sixth LIGO science data run. The targets were nine young supernova remnants
not associated with pulsars; eight of the remnants are associated with
non-pulsing suspected neutron stars. One target's parameters are uncertain
enough to warrant two searches, for a total of ten. Each search covered a broad
band of frequencies and first and second frequency derivatives for a fixed sky
direction. The searches coherently integrated data from the two LIGO
interferometers over time spans from 5.3-25.3 days using the matched-filtering
F-statistic. We found no credible gravitational-wave signals. We set 95%
confidence upper limits as strong (low) as $4\times10^{-25}$ on intrinsic
strain, $2\times10^{-7}$ on fiducial ellipticity, and $4\times10^{-5}$ on
r-mode amplitude. These beat the indirect limits from energy conservation and
are within the range of theoretical predictions for neutron-star ellipticities
and r-mode amplitudes.


A gravitational-wave standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant

  The detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic
waves heralds the age of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. On 17
August 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed GW170817, a strong
signal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than 2 seconds
after the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region
of the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the
gravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical
astronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transient
signal within $\sim 10$ arcsec of the galaxy NGC 4993. These multi-messenger
observations allow us to use GW170817 as a standard siren, the
gravitational-wave analog of an astronomical standard candle, to measure the
Hubble constant. This quantity, which represents the local expansion rate of
the Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental
importance to cosmology. Our measurement combines the distance to the source
inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity
inferred from measurements of the redshift using electromagnetic data. This
approach does not require any form of cosmic "distance ladder;" the
gravitational wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out
to cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical
distance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be
$70.0^{+12.0}_{-8.0} \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$
(maximum a posteriori and 68% credible interval). This is consistent with
existing measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additional
standard-siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will provide
precision constraints of this important cosmological parameter.


The DESI Experiment Part I: Science,Targeting, and Survey Design

  DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark
energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the
growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy
and quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution,
spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We
will measure luminous red galaxies up to $z=1.0$. To probe the Universe out to
even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up
to $z=1.7$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying
dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts ($ 2.1 < z < 3.5$), for the
Ly-$\alpha$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to
trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient
observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a
magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million
galaxies with a median $z\approx 0.2$. In total, more than 30 million galaxy
and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine
the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.


The DESI Experiment Part II: Instrument Design

  DESI (Dark Energy Spectropic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark
energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations and the growth
of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and
quasar redshift survey. The DESI instrument is a robotically-actuated,
fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking up to 5,000 simultaneous spectra over
a wavelength range from 360 nm to 980 nm. The fibers feed ten three-arm
spectrographs with resolution $R= \lambda/\Delta\lambda$ between 2000 and 5500,
depending on wavelength. The DESI instrument will be used to conduct a
five-year survey designed to cover 14,000 deg$^2$. This powerful instrument
will be installed at prime focus on the 4-m Mayall telescope in Kitt Peak,
Arizona, along with a new optical corrector, which will provide a three-degree
diameter field of view. The DESI collaboration will also deliver a
spectroscopic pipeline and data management system to reduce and archive all
data for eventual public use.


Localization and broadband follow-up of the gravitational-wave transient
  GW150914

  A gravitational-wave (GW) transient was identified in data recorded by the
Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors
on 2015 September 14. The event, initially designated G184098 and later given
the name GW150914, is described in detail elsewhere. By prior arrangement,
preliminary estimates of the time, significance, and sky location of the event
were shared with 63 teams of observers covering radio, optical, near-infrared,
X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths with ground- and space-based facilities. In
this Letter we describe the low-latency analysis of the GW data and present the
sky localization of the first observed compact binary merger. We summarize the
follow-up observations reported by 25 teams via private Gamma-ray Coordinates
Network circulars, giving an overview of the participating facilities, the GW
sky localization coverage, the timeline and depth of the observations. As this
event turned out to be a binary black hole merger, there is little expectation
of a detectable electromagnetic (EM) signature. Nevertheless, this first
broadband campaign to search for a counterpart of an Advanced LIGO source
represents a milestone and highlights the broad capabilities of the transient
astronomy community and the observing strategies that have been developed to
pursue neutron star binary merger events. Detailed investigations of the EM
data and results of the EM follow-up campaign are being disseminated in papers
by the individual teams.


Supplement: Localization and broadband follow-up of the
  gravitational-wave transient GW150914

  This Supplement provides supporting material for arXiv:1602.08492 . We
briefly summarize past electromagnetic (EM) follow-up efforts as well as the
organization and policy of the current EM follow-up program. We compare the
four probability sky maps produced for the gravitational-wave transient
GW150914, and provide additional details of the EM follow-up observations that
were performed in the different bands.
