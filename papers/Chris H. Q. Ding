An Iterative Locally Linear Embedding Algorithm

  Local Linear embedding (LLE) is a popular dimension reduction method. In this
paper, we first show LLE with nonnegative constraint is equivalent to the
widely used Laplacian embedding. We further propose to iterate the two steps in
LLE repeatedly to improve the results. Thirdly, we relax the kNN constraint of
LLE and present a sparse similarity learning algorithm. The final Iterative LLE
combines these three improvements. Extensive experiment results show that
iterative LLE algorithm significantly improve both classification and
clustering results.
