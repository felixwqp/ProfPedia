Joint measurements and Svetlichny's inequality

  We prove that the Svetlichny's inequality can be derived from the existenceof joint measurements and the principle of no-signaling. Then we show that, onthe basis of quantum measurement assumption, it would imply the breach ofcausality if the magnitude of violation of Svetlichny's inequality exceedsquantum bound.

Multi-Estimator Full Left Ventricle Quantification through Ensemble  Learning

  Cardiovascular disease accounts for 1 in every 4 deaths in United States.Accurate estimation of structural and functional cardiac parameters is crucialfor both diagnosis and disease management. In this work, we develop an ensemblelearning framework for more accurate and robust left ventricle (LV)quantification. The framework combines two 1st-level modules: direct estimationmodule and a segmentation module. The direct estimation module utilizesConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve end-to-end quantification. TheCNN is trained by taking 2D cardiac images as input and cardiac parameters asoutput. The segmentation module utilizes a U-Net architecture for obtainingpixel-wise prediction of the epicardium and endocardium of LV from thebackground. The binary U-Net output is then analyzed by a separate CNN forestimating the cardiac parameters. We then employ linear regression between the1st-level predictor and ground truth to learn a 2nd-level predictor thatensembles the results from 1st-level modules for the final estimation.Preliminary results by testing the proposed framework on the LVQuan18 datasetshow superior performance of the ensemble learning model over the two basemodules.

Entanglement Entropy in an Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Spin Chain with  Boundary Impurities

  The effects of boundary impurities on the entanglement entropy in anantiferromagnetic Heisenberg opened spin-$1/2$ chain are investigated. Themethod of density-matrix renormalization-group is used to obtain the bipartiteentanglement. The entropy increases when the length of the subsystem increases.It will approach to a constant when system length is very large. With the sameimpurity interaction, qutrit impurities of spin-$1$ can increase theentanglement entropy.

Linearized Alternating Direction Method with Adaptive Penalty and Warm  Starts for Fast Solving Transform Invariant Low-Rank Textures

  Transform Invariant Low-rank Textures (TILT) is a novel and powerful toolthat can effectively rectify a rich class of low-rank textures in 3D scenesfrom 2D images despite significant deformation and corruption. The existingalgorithm for solving TILT is based on the alternating direction method (ADM).It suffers from high computational cost and is not theoretically guaranteed toconverge to a correct solution. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm tospeed up solving TILT, with guaranteed convergence. Our method is based on therecently proposed linearized alternating direction method with adaptive penalty(LADMAP). To further reduce computation, warm starts are also introduced toinitialize the variables better and cut the cost on singular valuedecomposition. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datademonstrate that this new algorithm works much more efficiently and robustlythan the existing algorithm. It could be at least five times faster than theprevious method.

Comparative Document Analysis for Large Text Corpora

  This paper presents a novel research problem on joint discovery ofcommonalities and differences between two individual documents (or documentsets), called Comparative Document Analysis (CDA). Given any pair of documentsfrom a document collection, CDA aims to automatically identify sets of qualityphrases to summarize the commonalities of both documents and highlight thedistinctions of each with respect to the other informatively and concisely. Oursolution uses a general graph-based framework to derive novel measures onphrase semantic commonality and pairwise distinction}, and guides the selectionof sets of phrases by solving two joint optimization problems. We develop aniterative algorithm to integrate the maximization of phrase commonality ordistinction measure with the learning of phrase-document semantic relevance ina mutually enhancing way. Experiments on text corpora from two differentdomains---scientific publications and news---demonstrate the effectiveness androbustness of the proposed method on comparing individual documents. Our casestudy on comparing news articles published at different dates shows the powerof the proposed method on comparing document sets.

Recurrent Event Network for Reasoning over Temporal Knowledge Graphs

  Recently, there has been a surge of interest in learning representation ofgraph-structured data that are dynamically evolving. However, current dynamicgraph learning methods lack a principled way in modeling temporal,multi-relational, and concurrent interactions between nodes---a limitation thatis especially problematic for the task of temporal knowledge graph reasoning,where the goal is to predict unseen entity relationships (i.e., events) overtime. Here we present Recurrent Event Network (\method)---an architecture formodeling complex event sequences---which consists of a recurrent event encoderand a neighborhood aggregator. The event encoder employs a RNN to capture(subject, relation)-specific patterns from historical entity interactions;while the neighborhood aggregator summarizes concurrent interactions withineach time stamp. An output layer is designed for predicting forthcoming,multi-relational events. Experiments on temporal link prediction over twoknowledge graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,especially on multi-step inference over time.

The coordinate transformation and the exact solutions of the  Schrödinger equation with position-dependent effective mass

  Using the coordinate transformation method, we solve the one-dimensionalSchr\"{o}dinger equation with position-dependent mass(PDM). The explicitexpressions for the potentials, energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of thesystems are given. The eigenfunctions can be expressed in terms of the Jacobi,Hemite and generalized Laguerre polynomials. All potentials for these solvablesystems have an extra term $V_m$ which produced from the dependence of mass onthe coordinate, compared with that for the systems of constant mass. Theproperties of $V_m$ for several mass functions are discussed.

Label Noise Reduction in Entity Typing by Heterogeneous Partial-Label  Embedding

  Current systems of fine-grained entity typing use distant supervision inconjunction with existing knowledge bases to assign categories (type labels) toentity mentions. However, the type labels so obtained from knowledge bases areoften noisy (i.e., incorrect for the entity mention's local context). We definea new task, Label Noise Reduction in Entity Typing (LNR), to be the automaticidentification of correct type labels (type-paths) for training examples, giventhe set of candidate type labels obtained by distant supervision with a giventype hierarchy. The unknown type labels for individual entity mentions and thesemantic similarity between entity types pose unique challenges for solving theLNR task. We propose a general framework, called PLE, to jointly embed entitymentions, text features and entity types into the same low-dimensional spacewhere, in that space, objects whose types are semantically close have similarrepresentations. Then we estimate the type-path for each training example in atop-down manner using the learned embeddings. We formulate a global objectivefor learning the embeddings from text corpora and knowledge bases, which adoptsa novel margin-based loss that is robust to noisy labels and faithfully modelstype correlation derived from knowledge bases. Our experiments on three publictyping datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PLE, with anaverage of 25% improvement in accuracy compared to next best method.

CoType: Joint Extraction of Typed Entities and Relations with Knowledge  Bases

  Extracting entities and relations for types of interest from text isimportant for understanding massive text corpora. Traditionally, systems ofentity relation extraction have relied on human-annotated corpora for trainingand adopted an incremental pipeline. Such systems require additional humanexpertise to be ported to a new domain, and are vulnerable to errors cascadingdown the pipeline. In this paper, we investigate joint extraction of typedentities and relations with labeled data heuristically obtained from knowledgebases (i.e., distant supervision). As our algorithm for type labeling viadistant supervision is context-agnostic, noisy training data poses uniquechallenges for the task. We propose a novel domain-independent framework,called CoType, that runs a data-driven text segmentation algorithm to extractentity mentions, and jointly embeds entity mentions, relation mentions, textfeatures and type labels into two low-dimensional spaces (for entity andrelation mentions respectively), where, in each space, objects whose types areclose will also have similar representations. CoType, then using these learnedembeddings, estimates the types of test (unlinkable) mentions. We formulate ajoint optimization problem to learn embeddings from text corpora and knowledgebases, adopting a novel partial-label loss function for noisy labeled data andintroducing an object "translation" function to capture the cross-constraintsof entities and relations on each other. Experiments on three public datasetsdemonstrate the effectiveness of CoType across different domains (e.g., news,biomedical), with an average of 25% improvement in F1 score compared to thenext best method.

Learning Dual Retrieval Module for Semi-supervised Relation Extraction

  Relation extraction is an important task in structuring content of text data,and becomes especially challenging when learning with weak supervision---whereonly a limited number of labeled sentences are given and a large number ofunlabeled sentences are available. Most existing work exploits unlabeled databased on the ideas of self-training (i.e., bootstrapping a model) andmulti-view learning (e.g., ensembling multiple model variants). However, thesemethods either suffer from the issue of semantic drift, or do not fully capturethe problem characteristics of relation extraction. In this paper, we leveragea key insight that retrieving sentences expressing a relation is a dual task ofpredicting relation label for a given sentence---two tasks are complementary toeach other and can be optimized jointly for mutual enhancement. To model thisintuition, we propose DualRE, a principled framework that introduces aretrieval module which is jointly trained with the original relation predictionmodule. In this way, high-quality samples selected by retrieval module fromunlabeled data can be used to improve prediction module, and vice versa.Experimental results\footnote{\small Code and data can be found at\url{https://github.com/INK-USC/DualRE}.} on two public datasets as well ascase studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the DualRE approach.

Jointly Learning Explainable Rules for Recommendation with Knowledge  Graph

  Explainability and effectiveness are two key aspects for building recommendersystems. Prior efforts mostly focus on incorporating side information toachieve better recommendation performance. However, these methods have someweaknesses: (1) prediction of neural network-based embedding methods are hardto explain and debug; (2) symbolic, graph-based approaches (e.g., metapath-based models) require manual efforts and domain knowledge to definepatterns and rules, and ignore the item association types (e.g. substitutableand complementary). In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning frameworkto integrate \textit{induction of explainable rules from knowledge graph} with\textit{construction of a rule-guided neural recommendation model}. Theframework encourages two modules to complement each other in generatingeffective and explainable recommendation: 1) inductive rules, mined fromitem-centric knowledge graphs, summarize common multi-hop relational patternsfor inferring different item associations and provide human-readableexplanation for model prediction; 2) recommendation module can be augmented byinduced rules and thus have better generalization ability dealing with thecold-start issue. Extensive experiments\footnote{Code and data can be found at:\url{https://github.com/THUIR/RuleRec}} show that our proposed method hasachieved significant improvements in item recommendation over baselines onreal-world datasets. Our model demonstrates robust performance over "noisy"item knowledge graphs, generated by linking item names to related entities.

Superconducting properties and c-axis superstructure of Mg1-xAlxB2

  The superconducting and structural properties of a series of Mg1-xAlxB2samples have been investigated. X-ray diffraction results confirmed theexistence of a structural transition associated with the significant change ininter-boron layer distance as reported previously by Slusky et al.Moreover,transmission-electron-microscopy observations revealed the existenceof a superstructure with doubled lattice constant along the c-axis direction.We propose that this superstructure is essentially related to the structuraltransition. The modifications of superconducting transition temperature Tc, thenormal state resistivity, and the upper critical field Bc2 by Al doping arediscussed in terms of Al-substitution induced changes in the electronicstructure at the Fermi energy.

Bound on genuine multipartite correlations from the principle of  information causality

  Quantum mechanics is not the unique no-signaling theory which is endowed withstronger-than-classical correlations, and there exists a broad class ofno-signaling theories allowing even stronger-than-quantum correlations. Theprinciple of information causality has been suggested to distinguish quantumtheory from these nonphysical theories, together with an elegantinformation-theoretic proof of the quantum bound of two-particle correlations.In this work, we extend this to genuine $N$-particle correlations that cannotbe reduced to mixtures of states in which a smaller number of particles areentangled. We first express Svetlichny's inequality in terms of multipartiteno-signaling boxes, then prove that the strongest genuine multipartitecorrelations lead to the maximal violation of information causality. Themaximal genuine multipartite correlations under the constraint of informationcausality is found to be equal to the quantum mechanical bound. This resultconsolidates information causality as a physical principle defining thepossible correlations allowed by nature, and provides intriguing insights intothe limits of genuine multipartite correlations in quantum theory.

Predicting a Ferrimagnetic Phase of Zn2FeOsO6 with Strong  Magnetoelectric Coupling

  Multiferroic materials, in which ferroelectric and magnetic ordering coexist,are of fundamental interest for the development of novel memory devices thatallow for electrical writing and non-destructive magnetic readout operation.The great challenge is to create room temperature multiferroic materials withstrongly coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) orderings.BiFeO3 has been the most heavily investigated single-phase multiferroic to datedue to the coexistence of its magnetic order and ferroelectric order at roomtemperature. However, there is no net magnetic moment in the cycloidal(antiferromagnetic-like) magnetic state of bulk BiFeO3, which severely limitsits realistic applications in electric field controlled spintronic devices.Here, we predict that double perovskite Zn2FeOsO6 is a new multiferroic withproperties superior to BiFeO3. First, there are strong ferroelectricity andstrong ferrimagnetism at room temperature in Zn2FeOsO6. Second, the easy-planeof the spontaneous magnetization can be switched by an external electric field,evidencing the strong magnetoelectric coupling existing in this system. Ourresults suggest that ferrimagnetic 3d-5d double perovskite may therefore beused to achieve voltage control of magnetism in future spintronic devices.

Observation of acoustic spin

  Unlike optical waves, acoustic waves in fluids are described by scalarpressure fields, and therefore are considered spinless. Here, we demonstrateexperimentally the existence of spin in acoustics. In the interference of twoacoustic waves propagating perpendicularly to each other, we observed the spinangular momentum in free space as a result of the rotation of local particlevelocity. We successfully measured the acoustic spin, and spin induced torqueacting on a lossy acoustic meta-atom that results from absorption of the spinangular momentum. The acoustic spin is also observed in the evanescent field ofa guided mode traveling along a metamaterial waveguide. We found spin-momentumlocking in acoustic waves whose propagation direction is determined by the signof spin. The observed acoustic spin could open a new door in acoustics andtheir applications for the control of wave propagation and particle rotation.

Interplay between evolutionary game and network structure: the  coevolution of social net, cooperation and wealth

  We study the interplay between evolutionary game and network structure andshow how the dynamics of the game affect the growth pattern of the network andhow the evolution of the network influence the cooperative behavior in thegame. Simulation results show that the payoff-based preferential attachmentmechanism leads to the emergence of a scale-free structural property, $P(k)\simk^{-\gamma}$. Moreover, we investigate the average path length and theassortative mixing features. The obtained results indicate that the network hassmall-world and positive assortative behaviors, which are consistent with theobservations of some real social networks. In parallel, we found that theevolution of the underlying network structure effectively promotes thecooperation level of the game. We also investigate the wealth distributionobtained by our model, which is consistent with the Pareto law in the realobservation. In addition, the analysis of the generated scale-free networkstructure is provided for better understanding the evolutionary dynamics of ourmodel.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Macromolecules Using Graphics  Processing Unit

  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful computational tool to studythe behavior of macromolecular systems. But many simulations of this field arelimited in spatial or temporal scale by the available computational resource.In recent years, graphics processing unit (GPU) provides unprecedentedcomputational power for scientific applications. Many MD algorithms suit withthe multithread nature of GPU. In this paper, MD algorithms for macromolecularsystems that run entirely on GPU are presented. Compared to the MD simulationwith free software GROMACS on a single CPU core, our codes achieve about 10times speed-up on a single GPU. For validation, we have performed MDsimulations of polymer crystallization on GPU, and the results observedperfectly agree with computations on CPU. Therefore, our single GPU codes havealready provided an inexpensive alternative for macromolecular simulations ontraditional CPU clusters and they can also be used as a basis to developparallel GPU programs to further speedup the computations.

Electromagnetic, stress and thermal analysis of the Superconducting  Magnet

  Within the framework of the National Special Project for Magnetic ConfinedNuclear Fusion Energy of China, the design of a superconducting magnet projectas a test facility of the Nb3Sn coil or NbTi coil for the Chinese FusionEngineering Test Reactor (CFETR) has been carried out not only to estimate therelevant conductor performance but also to implement a background magneticfield for CFETR CS insert and toroidal field (TF) insert coils. Thesuperconducting magnet is composed of two parts: the inner part with Nb3Sncable-in-conduit conductor (CICC) and the outer part with NbTi CICC. Both partsare connected in series and powered by a single DC power supply. Thesuperconducting magnet can be cooled with supercritical helium at inlettemperature of 4.5 K. The total inductance and stored energy of thesuperconducting magnet are about 0.278 H and 436.6 MJ at an operating currentof 56 kA respectively. An active quench protection circuit was adopted totransfer the stored magnetic energy of the superconducting magnet during a dumpoperation. In this paper, the design of the superconducting magnet and the mainanalysis results of the electromagnetic, structural and thermal-hydraulicperformance are described.

Broadband frequency conversion via adiabatically tapered $χ^{(2)}$  waveguide in photonic integrated circuits

  We propose to use the integrated aluminum nitride waveguide with engineeredwidth variation to achieve optical frequency conversion based on $\chi^{(2)}$nonlinear effect on a photonic chip. We show that in an adiabatically taperedwaveguide, the frequency conversion has a much broader bandwidth and theefficiency within the bandwidth is almost constant, which is favorable forshort pulses. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically an "area law"for the frequency conversion, i.e. the product of bandwidth and efficiency isconserved as long as peak conversion efficiency does not saturate. Theadiabatic structure shows higher saturation thresholds in pump power orinteraction length, outperforming the conventional uniform waveguide design.With our approach, high-efficiency and wavefront-keeping conversion for shortpulses is possible on a photonic chip, which will surely find applications forscalable on-chip information processing.

Learning Named Entity Tagger using Domain-Specific Dictionary

  Recent advances in deep neural models allow us to build reliable named entityrecognition (NER) systems without handcrafting features. However, such methodsrequire large amounts of manually-labeled training data. There have beenefforts on replacing human annotations with distant supervision (in conjunctionwith external dictionaries), but the generated noisy labels pose significantchallenges on learning effective neural models. Here we propose two neuralmodels to suit noisy distant supervision from the dictionary. First, under thetraditional sequence labeling framework, we propose a revised fuzzy CRF layerto handle tokens with multiple possible labels. After identifying the nature ofnoisy labels in distant supervision, we go beyond the traditional framework andpropose a novel, more effective neural model AutoNER with a new Tie or Breakscheme. In addition, we discuss how to refine distant supervision for betterNER performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstratethat AutoNER achieves the best performance when only using dictionaries with noadditional human effort, and delivers competitive results with state-of-the-artsupervised benchmarks.

Heter-Sim: Heterogeneous multi-agent systems simulation by interactive  data-driven optimization

  Interactive multi-agent simulation algorithms are used to compute thetrajectories and behaviors of different entities in virtual reality scenarios.However, current methods involve considerable parameter tweaking to generateplausible behaviors. We introduce a novel approach (Heter-Sim) that combinesphysics-based simulation methods with data-driven techniques using anoptimization-based formulation. Our approach is general and can simulateheterogeneous agents corresponding to human crowds, traffic, vehicles, orcombinations of different agents with varying dynamics. We estimate motionstates from real-world datasets that include information about position,velocity, and control direction. Our optimization algorithm considers severalconstraints, including velocity continuity, collision avoidance, attraction,and direction control. To accelerate the computations, we reduce the searchspace for both collision avoidance and optimal solution computation. Heter-Simcan simulate tens or hundreds of agents at interactive rates and we compare itsaccuracy with real-world datasets and prior algorithms. We also perform userstudies that evaluate the plausible behaviors generated by our algorithm and auser study that evaluates the plausibility of our algorithm via VR.

Phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg alternating chain in a magnetic  field

  By using the infinite time-evolving block decimation, we study quantumfidelity and entanglement entropy in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg alternating chainunder an external magnetic field. The effects of the magnetic field on thefidelity are investigated, and its relation with the quantum phase transition(QPT) is analyzed. The phase diagram of the model is given accordingly, whichsupports the Haldane phase, the singlet-dimer phase, the Luttinger liquid phaseand the paramagnetic phase. The scaling of entanglement entropy in the gaplessLuttinger liquid phase is studied, and the central charge c = 1 is obtained. Wealso study the relationship between the quantum coherence, string orderparameter and QPTs. Results obtained from these quantum informationobservations are consistent with the previous reports.

Indirect Supervision for Relation Extraction using Question-Answer Pairs

  Automatic relation extraction (RE) for types of interest is of greatimportance for interpreting massive text corpora in an efficient manner.Traditional RE models have heavily relied on human-annotated corpus fortraining, which can be costly in generating labeled data and become obstacleswhen dealing with more relation types. Thus, more RE extraction systems haveshifted to be built upon training data automatically acquired by linking toknowledge bases (distant supervision). However, due to the incompleteness ofknowledge bases and the context-agnostic labeling, the training data collectedvia distant supervision (DS) can be very noisy. In recent years, as increasingattention has been brought to tackling question-answering (QA) tasks, userfeedback or datasets of such tasks become more accessible. In this paper, wepropose a novel framework, ReQuest, to leverage question-answer pairs as anindirect source of supervision for relation extraction, and study how to usesuch supervision to reduce noise induced from DS. Our model jointly embedsrelation mentions, types, QA entity mention pairs and text features in twolow-dimensional spaces (RE and QA), where objects with same relation types orsemantically similar question-answer pairs have similar representations. Sharedfeatures connect these two spaces, carrying clearer semantic knowledge fromboth sources. ReQuest, then use these learned embeddings to estimate the typesof test relation mentions. We formulate a global objective function and adopt anovel margin-based QA loss to reduce noise in DS by exploiting semanticevidence from the QA dataset. Our experimental results achieve an average of11% improvement in F1 score on two public RE datasets combined with TREC QAdataset.

Synaptic Learning and Memory Functions Achieved in Self-rectifying BFO  Memristor under Extreme Environmental Temperature

  Memristors have been intensively studied in recent years as promisingbuilding blocks for next-generation non-volatile memory, artificial neuralnetworks and brain-inspired computing systems. Even though the environmentadaptability of memristor has been required in many application fields, it hasbeen rarely reported due to the underlying mechanism could become invalidespecially at an elevated temperature. Here, we focus on achieving synapticlearning and memory functions in BiFeO3 memristor in a wide range oftemperature. We have proved the ferroelectricity of BFO films at a record-hightemperature of 500 {\deg}C by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) measurement.Due to the robust ferroelectricity of BFO thin film, an analog-like resistanceswitching behavior has been clearly found in a wide range of temperature, whichis attributed to the reversal of ferroelectric polarization. Various synapticfunctions including long-term potentiation (LTP), depression (LTD), consecutivepotentiation/depression (P/D) and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) havebeen realized from -170 to 300 {\deg}C, illustrating their potential forelectronic applications even under extreme environmental temperature.

Anomalous CDW ground state in Cu$_2$Se: a wave-like fluctuation of  $\it{dc}$ I-V curve near 50 K

  A charge density wave (CDW) ground state is observed in polycrystallineCu$_2$Se below 125 K, which corresponds to an energy gap of 40.9 meV and anelectron-phonon coupling constant of 0.6. Due to the polycrystalline structure,the Peierls transition process has been expanded to a wide temperature rangefrom 90 to 160 K. The Hall carrier concentration shows a continuous decreasefrom 2.1$\times$10$^{20}$ to 1.6$\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the temperaturerange from 160 K to 80 K, while almost unchanged above 160 K and below 90 K.After entering the CDW ground state, a wave-like fluctuation was observed inthe I-V curve near 50 K, which exhibits as a periodic negative differentialresistivity in an applied electric field due to the current. We alsoinvestigated the doping effect of Zn, Ni, and Te on the CDW ground state. BothZn and Ni doped Cu$_2$Se show a CDW character with increased energy gap andelectron-phonon coupling constant, but no notable Peierls transition wasobserved in Te doped Cu$_2$Se. Similar wave-like I-V curve was also seen inCu$_{1.98}$Zn$_{0.02}$Se near 40 K. The regular fluctuation in $\it{dc}$ I-Vcurve was not magnetic field sensitive, but temperature and sample sizesensitive.

Mapping the emission line strengths and kinematics of Supernova Remnant  S147 with extensive LAMOST spectroscopic observations

  We present extensive spectroscopic observations of supernova remnant (SNR)S147 collected with the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber SpectroscopicTelescope (LAMOST). The spectra were carefully sky-subtracted taking intoaccount the complex filamentary structure of S147. We have utilized allavailable LAMOST spectra toward S147, including sky and stellar spectra. Bymeasuring the prominent optical emission lines including H{\alpha},[NII]{\lambda}6584, and [SII]{\lambda}{\lambda}6717,6731, we present maps ofradial velocity and line intensity ratio covering the whole nebula of S147 withunprecedented detail. The maps spatially correlated well with the complexfilamentary structure of S147. For the central 2 deg of S147, the radialvelocity varies from -100 to 100 km/s and peaks between ~ 0 and 10 km/s. Theintensity ratios of H{\alpha}/[SII]{\lambda}{\lambda}6717,6731,[SII]{\lambda}6717/{\lambda}6731 and H{\alpha}/[NII]{\lambda}6584 peak at about0.77, 1.35 and 1.48, respectively, with a scatter of 0.17, 0.19 and 0.37,respectively. The intensity ratios are consistent with the literature values.However, the range of variations of line intensity ratios estimated here andrepresentative of the whole nebula, are larger than previously estimated.

The Localization of $s$-Wave and Quantum Effective Potential of a  Quasi-Free Particle with Position-Dependent Mass

  The properties of the s-wave for a quasi-free particle withposition-dependent mass(PDM) have been discussed in details. Differed from thesystem with constant mass in which the localization of the s-wave for the freequantum particle around the origin only occurs in two dimensions, thequasi-free particle with PDM can experience attractive forces in $D$ dimensionsexcept D=1 when its mass function satisfies some conditions. The effective massof a particle varying with its position can induce effective interaction whichmay be attractive in some cases. The analytical expressions of theeigenfunctions and the corresponding probability densities for the s-waves ofthe two- and three-dimensional systems with a special PDM are given, and theexistences of localization around the origin for these systems are shown.

Broadband opto-mechanical phase shifter for photonic integrated circuits

  A broadband opto-mechanical phase shifter for photonic integrated circuits isproposed and numerically investigated. The structure consists of amode-carrying waveguide and a deformable non-mode-carrying nanostring, whichare parallel with each other. Utilizing the optical gradient force betweenthem, the nanostring can be deflected. Thus the effective refractive indices ofthe waveguide is changed with the deformation, and further causes a phaseshift. The phase shift under different geometry sizes, launched powers andboundary conditions are calculated and the dynamical properties as well as thethermal noise's effect are also discussed. It is demonstrated that a $\pi$phase shift can be realized with only about 0.64 mW launched power and 50 $\mum$ long nanostring. The proposed phase shifter may find potential usage infuture investigation of photonic integrated circuits.

Neutron scattering study of correlated phase behavior in Sr2IrO4

  Neutron diffraction measurements are presented exploring the magnetic andstructural phase behaviors of the candidate J$_{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulatingiridate Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Comparisons are drawn between the correlated magnetismin this single layer system and its bilayer analog Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ where bothmaterials exhibit magnetic domains originating from crystallographic twinningand comparable moment sizes. Weakly temperature dependent superlattice peaksviolating the reported tetragonal space group of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ are observedsupporting the notion of a lower structural symmetry arising from a hightemperature lattice distortion, and we use this to argue that moments orientalong a unique in-plane axis demonstrating an orthorhombic symmetry in theresulting spin structure. Our results demonstrate that the correlated spinorder and structural phase behaviors in both single and bilayerSr$_{n+1}$Ir$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ systems are remarkably similar and suggestcomparable correlation strengths in each system.

A Nanoscale Shape Memory Oxide

  Stimulus-responsive shape memory materials have attracted tremendous researchinterests recently, with much effort focused on improving their mechanicalactuation. Driven by the needs of nanoelectromechnical devices, materials withlarge mechanical strain particularly at nanoscale are therefore desired. Herewe report on the discovery of a large shape memory effect in BiFeO3 at thenanoscale. A maximum strain of up to ~14% and a large volumetric work densitycan be achieved in association with a martensitic-like phase transformation.With a single step, control of the phase transformation by thermal activationor electric field has been reversibly achieved without the assistance ofexternal recovery stress. Although aspects such as hysteresis, micro-crackingetc. have to be taken into consideration for real devices, the large shapememory effect in this oxide surpasses most alloys and therefore demonstratesitself as an extraordinary material for potential use in state-of-artnano-systems.

Distributed Compressive Sensing Based Doubly Selective Channel  Estimation for Large-Scale MIMO Systems

  Doubly selective (DS) channel estimation in largescale multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) systems is a challenging problem due to the requirementof unaffordable pilot overheads and prohibitive complexity. In this paper, wepropose a novel distributed compressive sensing (DCS) based channel estimationscheme to solve this problem. In the scheme, we introduce the basis expansionmodel (BEM) to reduce the required channel coefficients and pilot overheads.And due to the common sparsity of all the transmit-receive antenna pairs indelay domain, we estimate the BEM coefficients by considering the DCSframework, which has a simple linear structure with low complexity. Furthermore, a linear smoothing method is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy.Finally, we conduct various simulations to verify the validity of the proposedscheme and demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed scheme comparedwith conventional schemes.

Tailoring reflection of graphene plasmons by focused ion beams

  Graphene plasmons are of remarkable features that make graphene plasmonelements promising for applications to integrated photonic devices. Thefabrication of graphene plasmon components and control over plasmon propagatingare of fundamental important. Through near-field plasmon imaging, wedemonstrate controllable modifying of the reflection of graphene plasmon atboundaries etched by ion beams. Moreover, by varying ion dose at a propervalue, nature like reflection boundary can be obtained. We also investigate theinfluence of ion beam incident angle on plasmon reflection. To illustrate theapplication of ion beam etching, a simple graphene wedge-shape plasmonstructure is fabricated and performs excellently, proving this technology as asimple and efficient tool for controlling graphene plasmons.

Content-Based Top-N Recommendation using Heterogeneous Relations

  Top-$N$ recommender systems have been extensively studied. However, thesparsity of user-item activities has not been well resolved. While many hybridsystems were proposed to address the cold-start problem, the profileinformation has not been sufficiently leveraged. Furthermore, the heterogeneityof profiles between users and items intensifies the challenge. In this paper,we propose a content-based top-$N$ recommender system by learning the globalterm weights in profiles. To achieve this, we bring in PathSim, which couldwell measures the node similarity with heterogeneous relations (between usersand items). Starting from the original TF-IDF value, the global term weightsgradually converge, and eventually reflect both profile and activityinformation. To facilitate training, the derivative is reformulated into matrixform, which could easily be paralleled. We conduct extensive experiments, whichdemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Terahertz-frequency magnon-phonon-polaritons in the strong coupling  regime

  Strong coupling between light and matter occurs when the two interactstrongly enough to form new hybrid modes called polaritons. Here we report onthe strong coupling of both the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom to anultrafast terahertz (THz) frequency electromagnetic wave. In our system,optical phonons in a slab of ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$) arestrongly coupled to a THz electric field to form phonon-polaritons, which aresimultaneously strongly coupled to magnons in an adjacent slab of cantedantiferromagnetic erbium orthoferrite (ErFeO$_3$) via the THz magnetic field.The strong coupling leads to the formation of new magnon-phonon-polaritonmodes, which we experimentally observe in the wavevector-frequency dispersioncurve as an avoided crossing and in the time-domain as a normal-mode beating.Our simple yet versatile on-chip waveguide platform provides a promising avenueby which to explore both ultrafast THz spintronics applications and the quantumnature of the interaction.

Heterogeneous Supervision for Relation Extraction: A Representation  Learning Approach

  Relation extraction is a fundamental task in information extraction. Mostexisting methods have heavy reliance on annotations labeled by human experts,which are costly and time-consuming. To overcome this drawback, we propose anovel framework, REHession, to conduct relation extractor learning usingannotations from heterogeneous information source, e.g., knowledge base anddomain heuristics. These annotations, referred as heterogeneous supervision,often conflict with each other, which brings a new challenge to the originalrelation extraction task: how to infer the true label from noisy labels for agiven instance. Identifying context information as the backbone of bothrelation extraction and true label discovery, we adopt embedding techniques tolearn the distributed representations of context, which bridges all componentswith mutual enhancement in an iterative fashion. Extensive experimental resultsdemonstrate the superiority of REHession over the state-of-the-art.

An Attention-based Collaboration Framework for Multi-View Network  Representation Learning

  Learning distributed node representations in networks has been attractingincreasing attention recently due to its effectiveness in a variety ofapplications. Existing approaches usually study networks with a single type ofproximity between nodes, which defines a single view of a network. However, inreality there usually exists multiple types of proximities between nodes,yielding networks with multiple views. This paper studies learning noderepresentations for networks with multiple views, which aims to infer robustnode representations across different views. We propose a multi-viewrepresentation learning approach, which promotes the collaboration of differentviews and lets them vote for the robust representations. During the votingprocess, an attention mechanism is introduced, which enables each node to focuson the most informative views. Experimental results on real-world networks showthat the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches fornetwork representation learning with a single view and other competitiveapproaches with multiple views.

Cross-type Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Deep Multi-Task  Learning

  Motivation: State-of-the-art biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER)systems often require handcrafted features specific to each entity type, suchas genes, chemicals and diseases. Although recent studies explored using neuralnetwork models for BioNER to free experts from manual feature engineering, theperformance remains limited by the available training data for each entitytype. Results: We propose a multi-task learning framework for BioNER tocollectively use the training data of different types of entities and improvethe performance on each of them. In experiments on 15 benchmark BioNERdatasets, our multi-task model achieves substantially better performancecompared with state-of-the-art BioNER systems and baseline neural sequencelabeling models. Further analysis shows that the large performance gains comefrom sharing character- and word-level information among relevant biomedicalentities across differently labeled corpora.

Efficient Contextualized Representation: Language Model Pruning for  Sequence Labeling

  Many efforts have been made to facilitate natural language processing taskswith pre-trained language models (LMs), and brought significant improvements tovarious applications. To fully leverage the nearly unlimited corpora andcapture linguistic information of multifarious levels, large-size LMs arerequired; but for a specific task, only parts of these information are useful.Such large-sized LMs, even in the inference stage, may cause heavy computationworkloads, making them too time-consuming for large-scale applications. Here wepropose to compress bulky LMs while preserving useful information with regardto a specific task. As different layers of the model keep differentinformation, we develop a layer selection method for model pruning usingsparsity-inducing regularization. By introducing the dense connectivity, we candetach any layer without affecting others, and stretch shallow and wide LMs tobe deep and narrow. In model training, LMs are learned with layer-wise dropoutsfor better robustness. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate theeffectiveness of our method.

End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Taxonomy Induction

  We present a novel end-to-end reinforcement learning approach to automatictaxonomy induction from a set of terms. While prior methods treat the problemas a two-phase task (i.e., detecting hypernymy pairs followed by organizingthese pairs into a tree-structured hierarchy), we argue that such two-phasemethods may suffer from error propagation, and cannot effectively optimizemetrics that capture the holistic structure of a taxonomy. In our approach, therepresentations of term pairs are learned using multiple sources of informationand used to determine \textit{which} term to select and \textit{where} to placeit on the taxonomy via a policy network. All components are trained in anend-to-end manner with cumulative rewards, measured by a holistic tree metricover the training taxonomies. Experiments on two public datasets of differentdomains show that our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art taxonomyinduction methods up to 19.6\% on ancestor F1.

Confinement-induced Resonance of Alkaline-earth-metal-like Atoms in  Anisotropic Quasi-one-dimensional Traps

  We study the confinement-induced resonance (CIR) of $^{173}$Yb atoms near anorbital Feshbach resonance in a quasi-one-dimensional tube with transversalanisotropy. By solving the two-body scattering problem, we obtain the locationof CIR for various anisotropy ratio and magnetic field. Our results show thatthe anisotropy of the trapping potential can serve as an additional knob totune the location of CIR. In particular, one can shift the location of CIR tothe region attainable in current experiment. We also study the energy spectrumof the system and analyze the properties of CIR from the perspective of boundstates. We find that as the orbital Feshbach resonance acquires two nearlydegenerate scattering channels, which in general have different thresholdenergies, CIR takes place when the closed channel bound state energy becomesdegenerate with one of the thresholds.

Entanglement detection by violations of noisy uncertainty relations: A  proof of principle

  It is well-known that the violation of a local uncertainty relation can beused as an indicator for the presence of entanglement. Unfortunately, thepractical use of these non-linear witnesses has been limited to few specialcases in the past. However, new methods for computing uncertainty bounds becameavailable. Here we report on an experimental implementation ofuncertainty-based entanglement witnesses, benchmarked in a regime dominated bystrong local noise. We combine the new computational method with a local noisetomography in order to design noise-adapted entanglement witnesses. Thisproof-of-principle experiment shows that quantum noise can be successfullyhandled by a fully quantum model in order to enhance entanglement detectionefficiencies.

Mining Entity Synonyms with Efficient Neural Set Generation

  Mining entity synonym sets (i.e., sets of terms referring to the same entity)is an important task for many entity-leveraging applications. Previous workeither rank terms based on their similarity to a given query term, or treatsthe problem as a two-phase task (i.e., detecting synonymy pairs, followed byorganizing these pairs into synonym sets). However, these approaches fail tomodel the holistic semantics of a set and suffer from the error propagationissue. Here we propose a new framework, named SynSetMine, that efficientlygenerates entity synonym sets from a given vocabulary, using example sets fromexternal knowledge bases as distant supervision. SynSetMine consists of twonovel modules: (1) a set-instance classifier that jointly learns how torepresent a permutation invariant synonym set and whether to include a newinstance (i.e., a term) into the set, and (2) a set generation algorithm thatenumerates the vocabulary only once and applies the learned set-instanceclassifier to detect all entity synonym sets in it. Experiments on three realdatasets from different domains demonstrate both effectiveness and efficiencyof SynSetMine for mining entity synonym sets.

Cross-relation Cross-bag Attention for Distantly-supervised Relation  Extraction

  Distant supervision leverages knowledge bases to automatically labelinstances, thus allowing us to train relation extractor without humanannotations. However, the generated training data typically contain massivenoise, and may result in poor performances with the vanilla supervisedlearning. In this paper, we propose to conduct multi-instance learning with anovel Cross-relation Cross-bag Selective Attention (C$^2$SA), which leads tonoise-robust training for distant supervised relation extractor. Specifically,we employ the sentence-level selective attention to reduce the effect of noisyor mismatched sentences, while the correlation among relations were captured toimprove the quality of attention weights. Moreover, instead of treating allentity-pairs equally, we try to pay more attention to entity-pairs with ahigher quality. Similarly, we adopt the selective attention mechanism toachieve this goal. Experiments with two types of relation extractor demonstratethe superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art, whilefurther ablation studies verify our intuitions and demonstrate theeffectiveness of our proposed two techniques.

First dark matter search results from the PandaX-I experiment

  We report on the first dark-matter (DM) search results from PandaX-I, a lowthreshold dual-phase xenon experiment operating at the China JinpingUnderground Laboratory. In the 37-kg liquid xenon target with 17.4 live-days ofexposure, no DM particle candidate event was found. This result sets astringent limit for low-mass DM particles and disfavors the interpretation ofpreviously-reported positive experimental results. The minimum upper limit,$3.7\times10^{-44}$\,cm$^2$, for the spin-independent isoscalarDM-particle-nucleon scattering cross section is obtained at a DM-particle massof 49\,GeV/c$^2$ at 90\% confidence level.

Low-mass dark matter search results from full exposure of PandaX-I  experiment

  We report the results of a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) darkmatter search using the full 80.1\;live-day exposure of the first stage of thePandaX experiment (PandaX-I) located in the China Jin-Ping UndergroundLaboratory. The PandaX-I detector has been optimized for detecting low-massWIMPs, achieving a photon detection efficiency of 9.6\%. With a fiducial liquidxenon target mass of 54.0\,kg, no significant excess event were found above theexpected background. A profile likelihood analysis confirms our earlier findingthat the PandaX-I data disfavor all positive low-mass WIMP signals reported inthe literature under standard assumptions. A stringent bound on the low massWIMP is set at WIMP mass below 10\,GeV/c$^2$, demonstrating that liquid xenondetectors can be competitive for low-mass WIMP searches.

Estimating stellar atmospheric parameters, absolute magnitudes and  elemental abundances from the LAMOST spectra with Kernel-based Principal  Component Analysis

  Accurate determination of stellar atmospheric parameters and elementalabundances is crucial for Galactic archeology via large-scale spectroscopicsurveys. In this paper, we estimate stellar atmospheric parameters -- effectivetemperature T_{\rm eff}, surface gravity log g and metallicity [Fe/H], absolutemagnitudes M_V and M_{Ks}, {\alpha}-element to metal (and iron) abundance ratio[{\alpha}/M] (and [{\alpha}/Fe]), as well as carbon and nitrogen abundances[C/H] and [N/H] from the LAMOST spectra with amultivariate regressionmethodbased on kernel-based principal component analysis, using stars in common withother surveys (Hipparcos, Kepler, APOGEE) as training data sets. Both internaland external examinations indicate that given a spectral signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) better than 50, our method is capable of delivering stellar parameterswith a precision of ~100K for Teff, ~0.1 dex for log g, 0.3 -- 0.4mag for M_Vand M_{Ks}, 0.1 dex for [Fe/H], [C/H] and [N/H], and better than 0.05 dex for[{\alpha}/M] ([{\alpha}/Fe]). The results are satisfactory even for a spectralSNR of 20. The work presents first determinations of [C/H] and [N/H] abundancesfrom a vast data set of LAMOST, and, to our knowledge, the first reportedimplementation of absolute magnitude estimation directly based on the observedspectra. The derived stellar parameters for millions of stars from the LAMOSTsurveys will be publicly available in the form of value-added catalogues.

LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anticentre (LSS-GAC): the  second release of value-added catalogues

  We present the second release of value-added catalogues of the LAMOSTSpectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anticentre (LSS-GAC DR2). The cataloguespresent values of radial velocity $V_{\rm r}$, atmospheric parameters ---effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity log$g$, metallicity[Fe/H], $\alpha$-element to iron (metal) abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe]([$\alpha$/M]), elemental abundances [C/H] and [N/H], and absolute magnitudes${\rm M}_V$ and ${\rm M}_{K_{\rm s}}$ deduced from 1.8 million spectra of 1.4million unique stars targeted by the LSS-GAC since September 2011 until June2014. The catalogues also give values of interstellar reddening, distance andorbital parameters determined with a variety of techniques, as well as propermotions and multi-band photometry from the far-UV to the mid-IR collected fromthe literature and various surveys. Accuracies of radial velocities reach5kms$^{-1}$ for late-type stars, and those of distance estimates range between10 -- 30 per cent, depending on the spectral signal-to-noise ratios. Precisionsof [Fe/H], [C/H] and [N/H] estimates reach 0.1dex, and those of [$\alpha$/Fe]and [$\alpha$/M] reach 0.05dex. The large number of stars, the contiguous skycoverage, the simple yet non-trivial target selection function and the robustestimates of stellar radial velocities and atmospheric parameters, distancesand elemental abundances, make the catalogues a valuable data set to study thestructure and evolution of the Galaxy, especially the solar-neighbourhood andthe outer disk.

Ages and masses of million Galactic disk main sequence turn-off and  sub-giant stars from the LAMOST Galactic spectroscopic surveys

  We present estimates of stellar age and mass for 0.93 million Galactic diskmain sequence turn-off and sub-giant stars from the LAMOST GalacticSpectroscopic Surveys. The ages and masses are determined by matching withstellar isochrones using Bayesian algorithm, utilizing effective temperature$T_{\rm eff}$, absolute magnitude ${\rm M}_V$, metallicity [Fe/H] and$\alpha$-element to iron abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe] deduced from the LAMOSTspectra. Extensive examinations suggest the age and mass estimates are robust.The overall sample stars have a median error of 34 per cent for the ageestimates, and half of the stars older than 2\,Gyr have age uncertainties ofonly 20--30 per cent. Median error for the mass estimates of the whole samplestars is $\sim8$ per cent. The huge dataset demonstrates good correlationsamong stellar age, [Fe/H] ([$\alpha$/H]) and [$\alpha$/Fe]. Particularly,double sequence features are revealed in the both the age--[$\alpha$/Fe] andage--[Fe/H]([$\alpha$/H]) spaces. In the [Fe/H]--[$\alpha$/Fe] space, stars of8--10\,Gyr exhibit both the thin and thick disk sequences, while younger(older) stars show only the thin (thick) disk sequence, indicating that thethin disk became prominent 8--10\,Gyr ago, while the thick disk formed earlierand almost quenched 8\,Gyr ago. Stellar ages exhibit positive vertical andnegative radial gradients across the disk, and the outer disk of$R\gtrsim$\,9\,kpc exhibits a strong flare in stellar age distribution.

White dwarf-main sequence binaries from LAMOST: the DR1 catalogue

  Context. White dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binaries are used to study severaldifferent important open problems in modern astrophysics.  Aims. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) identified the largest catalogue ofWDMS binaries currently known. However, this sample is seriously affected byselection effects and the population of systems containing cool white dwarfsand early-type companions is under-represented.Here we search for WDMS binarieswithin the spectroscopic data release 1 of the LAMOST (Large sky AreaMulti-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope) survey. LAMOST and SDSS followdifferent target selection algorithms. Hence, LAMOST WDMS binaries may be drawnfrom a different parent population and thus help in overcoming the selectioneffects incorporated by SDSS on the current observed population.  Methods. We develop a fast and efficient routine based on the wavelettransform to identify LAMOST WDMS binaries containing a DA white dwarf and a Mdwarf companion, and apply a decomposition/fitting routine to their LAMOSTspectra to estimate their distances and measure their stellar parameters,namely the white dwarf effective temperatures, surface gravities and masses,and the secondary star spectral types.  Results. We identify 121 LAMOST WDMS binaries, 80 of which are newdiscoveries, and estimate the sample to be \sim90 per cent complete. The LAMOSTand SDSS WDMS binaries are found to be statistically different. However, thisresult is not due to the different target selection criteria of both surveys,but likely a simple consequence of the different observing conditions. Thus,the LAMOST population is found at considerably shorter distances (\sim50-450pc) and is dominated by systems containing early-type companions and hot whitedwarfs. (abridged)

On the LSP3 estimates of surface gravity for LAMOST-Kepler stars with  asteroseismic measurements

  Asteroseismology allows for deriving precise values of surface gravity ofstars. The accurate asteroseismic determinations now available for large numberof stars in the Kepler fields can be used to check and calibrate surfacegravities that are currently being obtained spectroscopically for a hugenumbers of stars targeted by large-scale spectroscopic surveys, such as theon-going Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST)Galactic survey. The LAMOST spectral surveys have obtained a large number ofstellar spectra in the Kepler fields. Stellar atmospheric parameters of thosestars have been determined with the LAMOST Stellar Parameter Pipeline at PekingUniversity (LSP3), by template matching with the MILES empirical spectrallibrary. In the current work, we compare surface gravities yielded by LSP3 withthose of two asteroseismic samples - the largest sample from Huber et al.(2014) and the most accurate sample from Hekker et al. (2012, 2013). We findthat LSP3 surface gravities are in good agreement with asteroseismic values ofHekker et al. (2012, 2013), with a dispersion of about 0.2 dex. Except for afew cases, asteroseismic surface gravities of Huber et al. (2014) and LSP3spectroscopic values agree for a wide range of surface gravities. However, somepatterns of differences can be identified upon close inspection. Potential waysto further improve the LSP3 spectroscopic estimation of stellar atmosphericparameters in the near future are briefly discussed. The effects of effectivetemperature and metallicity on asteroseismic determinations of surfacegravities for giant stars are also discussed.
