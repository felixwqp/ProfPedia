Node Weighted Scheduling

  This paper proposes a new class of online policies for scheduling ininput-buffered crossbar switches. Our policies are throughput optimal for alarge class of arrival processes which satisfy strong-law of large numbers.Given an initial configuration and no further arrivals, our policies drain allpackets in the system in the minimal amount of time (providing an onlinealternative to the batch approach based on Birkhoff-VonNeumann decompositions).We show that it is possible for policies in our class to be throughput optimaleven if they are not constrained to be maximal in every time slot.  Most algorithms for switch scheduling take an edge based approach; incontrast, we focus on scheduling (a large enough set of) the most congestedports. This alternate approach allows for lower-complexity algorithms, and alsorequires a non-standard technique to prove throughput-optimality. One algorithmin our class, Maximum Vertex-weighted Matching (MVM) has worst-case complexitysimilar to Max-size Matching, and in simulations shows slightly better delayperformance than Max-(edge)weighted-Matching (MWM).

Scheduling with Rate Adaptation under Incomplete Knowledge of  Channel/Estimator Statistics

  In time-varying wireless networks, the states of the communication channelsare subject to random variations, and hence need to be estimated for efficientrate adaptation and scheduling. The estimation mechanism possesses inaccuraciesthat need to be tackled in a probabilistic framework. In this work, we studyscheduling with rate adaptation in single-hop queueing networks under twolevels of channel uncertainty: when the channel estimates are inaccurate butcomplete knowledge of the channel/estimator joint statistics is available atthe scheduler; and when the knowledge of the joint statistics is incomplete. Inthe former case, we characterize the network stability region and show that amaximum-weight type scheduling policy is throughput-optimal. In the lattercase, we propose a joint channel statistics learning - scheduling policy. Withan associated trade-off in average packet delay and convergence time, theproposed policy has a stability region arbitrarily close to the stabilityregion of the network under full knowledge of channel/estimator jointstatistics.

Secrecy Outage Capacity of Fading Channels

  This paper considers point to point secure communication over flat fadingchannels under an outage constraint. More specifically, we extend thedefinition of outage capacity to account for the secrecy constraint and obtainsharp characterizations of the corresponding fundamental limits under twodifferent assumptions on the transmitter CSI (Channel state information).First, we find the outage secrecy capacity assuming that the transmitter hasperfect knowledge of the legitimate and eavesdropper channel gains. In thisscenario, the capacity achieving scheme relies on opportunistically exchangingprivate keys between the legitimate nodes. These keys are stored in a keybuffer and later used to secure delay sensitive data using the Vernam's onetime pad technique. We then extend our results to the more practical scenariowhere the transmitter is assumed to know only the legitimate channel gain.Here, our achievability arguments rely on privacy amplification techniques togenerate secret key bits. In the two cases, we also characterize the optimalpower control policies which, interestingly, turn out to be a judiciouscombination of channel inversion and the optimal ergodic strategy. Finally, weanalyze the effect of key buffer overflow on the overall outage probability.

An Analytical Approach to the Adoption of Asymmetric Bidirectional  Firewalls: Need for Regulation?

  Recent incidents of cybersecurity violations have revealed the importance ofhaving firewalls and other intrusion detection systems to monitor trafficentering and leaving access networks. But the adoption of such securitymeasures is often stymied by `free-riding' effects and `shortsightedness' amongInternet service providers (ISPs). In this work, we develop an analyticalframework that not only accounts for these issues but also incorporatestechnological factors, like asymmetries in the performance of bidirectionalfirewalls. Results on the equilibrium adoption and stability are presented,along with detailed analysis on several policy issues related to socialwelfare, price of anarchy, and price of shortsightedness.

Low-complexity Optimal Scheduling over Correlated Fading Channels with  ARQ Feedback

  We investigate the downlink scheduling problem under Markovian ON/OFF fadingchannels, where the instantaneous channel state information is not directlyaccessible, but is revealed via ARQ-type feedback. The scheduler can exploitthe temporal correlation/channel memory inherent in the Markovian channels toimprove network performance. However, designing low-complexity andthroughput-optimal algorithms under temporal correlation is a challengingproblem. In this paper, we find that under an average number of transmissionsconstraint, a low-complexity index policy is throughput-optimal. The policyuses Whittle's index value, which was previously used to capture opportunisticscheduling under temporally correlated channels. Our results build on theinteresting finding that, under the intricate queue length and channel memoryevolutions, the importance of scheduling a user is captured by a simplemultiplication of its queue length and Whittle's index value. The proposedqueue-based index policy has provably low complexity. Numerical results showthat significant throughput gains can be realized by exploiting the channelmemory using the proposed low-complexity policy.

On the Generalized Delay-Capacity Tradeoff of Mobile Networks with  Lévy Flight Mobility

  In the literature, scaling laws for wireless mobile networks have beencharacterized under various models of node mobility and several assumptions onhow communication occurs between nodes. To improve the realism in the analysisof scaling laws, we propose a new analytical framework. The framework is thefirst to consider a L\'{e}vy flight mobility pattern, which is known to closelymimic human mobility patterns. Also, this is the first work that allows nodesto communicate while being mobile. Under this framework, delays ($\bar{D}$) toobtain various levels of per-node throughput $(\lambda)$ for L\'evy flight aresuggested as $\bar{D}(\lambda) = O(\sqrt{\min (n^{1+\alpha} \lambda, n^2)})$,where L\'evy flight is a random walk of a power-law flight distribution with anexponent $\alpha \in (0,2]$. The same framework presents a new tighter tradeoff$\bar{D}(\lambda) = O(\sqrt{\max (1,n\lambda^3)})$ for \textit{i.i.d.}mobility, whose delays are lower than existing results for the same levels ofper-node throughput.

Throughput of Rateless Codes over Broadcast Erasure Channels

  In this paper, we characterize the throughput of a broadcast network with nreceivers using rateless codes with block size K. We assume that the underlyingchannel is a Markov modulated erasure channel that is i.i.d. across users, butcan be correlated in time. We characterize the system throughput asymptoticallyin n. Specifically, we explicitly show how the throughput behaves for differentvalues of the coding block size K as a function of n, as n approaches infinity.For finite values of K and n, under the more restrictive assumption ofGilbert-Elliott channels, we are able to provide a lower bound on the maximumachievable throughput. Using simulations we show the tightness of the boundwith respect to system parameters n and K, and find that its performance issignificantly better than the previously known lower bounds.

Maximizing System Throughput Using Cooperative Sensing in Multi-Channel  Cognitive Radio Networks

  In Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), unlicensed users are allowed to accessthe licensed spectrum when it is not currently being used by primary users(PUs). In this paper, we study the throughput maximization problem for amulti-channel CRN where each SU can only sense a limited number of channels. Weshow that this problem is strongly NP-hard, and propose an approximationalgorithm with a factor at least $1/2\mu$ where $\mu \in [1,2]$ is a systemparameter reflecting the sensing capability of SUs across channels and theirsensing budgets. This performance guarantee is achieved by exploiting a nicestructural property of the objective function and constructing a particularmatching. Our numerical results demonstrate the advantage of our algorithmcompared with both a random and a greedy sensing assignment algorithm.

Graph-Theoretic Characterization of The Feasibility of The  Precoding-Based 3-Unicast Interference Alignment Scheme

  A new precoding-based intersession network coding (NC) scheme has recentlybeen proposed, which applies the interference alignment technique, originallydevised for wireless interference channels, to the 3-unicast problem ofdirected acyclic networks. The main result of this work is a graph-theoreticcharacterization of the feasibility of the 3-unicast interference alignmentscheme. To that end, we first investigate several key relationships between thepoint-to-point network channel gains and the underlying graph structure. Suchrelationships turn out to be critical when characterizing graph-theoreticallythe feasibility of precoding-based solutions.

Life-Add: Lifetime Adjustable Design for WiFi Networks with  Heterogeneous Energy Supplies

  WiFi usage significantly reduces the battery lifetime of handheld devicessuch as smartphones and tablets, due to its high energy consumption. In thispaper, we propose "Life-Add": a Lifetime Adjustable design for WiFi networks,where the devices are powered by battery, electric power, and/or renewableenergy. In Life-Add, a device turns off its radio to save energy when thechannel is sensed to be busy, and sleeps for a random time period beforesensing the channel again. Life-Add carefully controls the devices' averagesleep periods to improve their throughput while satisfying their operation timerequirement. It is proven that Life-Add achieves near-optimal proportional-fairutility performance for single access point (AP) scenarios. Moreover, Life-Addalleviates the near-far effect and hidden terminal problem in general multipleAP scenarios. Our ns-3 simulations show that Life-Add simultaneously improvesthe lifetime, throughput, and fairness performance of WiFi networks, andcoexists harmoniously with IEEE 802.11.

Optimal Energy-Aware Epidemic Routing in DTNs

  In this work, we investigate the use of epidemic routing in energyconstrained Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). In epidemic routing, messages arerelayed by intermediate nodes at contact opportunities, i.e., when pairs ofnodes come within the transmission range of each other. Each node needs todecide whether to forward its message upon contact with a new node based on itsown residual energy level and the age of that message. We mathematicallycharacterize the fundamental trade-off between energy conservation and ameasure of Quality of Service as a dynamic energy-dependent optimal controlproblem. We prove that in the mean-field regime, the optimal dynamic forwardingdecisions follow simple threshold-based structures in which the forwardingthreshold for each node depends on its current remaining energy. We thencharacterize the nature of this dependence. Our simulations reveal that theoptimal dynamic policy significantly outperforms heuristics.

Scheduling of Multicast and Unicast Services under Limited Feedback by  using Rateless Codes

  Many opportunistic scheduling techniques are impractical because they requireaccurate channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. In this paper, weinvestigate the scheduling of unicast and multicast services in a downlinknetwork with a very limited amount of feedback information. Specifically,unicast users send imperfect (or no) CSI and infrequent acknowledgements (ACKs)to a base station, and multicast users only report infrequent ACKs to avoidfeedback implosion. We consider the use of physical-layer rateless codes, whichnot only combats channel uncertainty, but also reduces the overhead of ACKfeedback. A joint scheduling and power allocation scheme is developed torealize multiuser diversity gain for unicast service and multicast gain formulticast service. We prove that our scheme achieves a near-optimal throughputregion. Our simulation results show that our scheme significantly improves thenetwork throughput over schemes employing fixed-rate codes or using onlyunicast communications.

Age-Optimal Information Updates in Multihop Networks

  The problem of reducing the age-of-information has been extensively studiedin the single-hop networks. In this paper, we minimize the age-of-informationin general multihop networks. If the packet transmission times over the networklinks are exponentially distributed, we prove that a preemptive Last GeneratedFirst Served (LGFS) policy results in smaller age processes at all nodes of thenetwork (in a stochastic ordering sense) than any other causal policy. Inaddition, for arbitrary general distributions of packet transmission times, thenon-preemptive LGFS policy is shown to minimize the age processes at all nodesof the network among all non-preemptive work-conserving policies (again in astochastic ordering sense). It is surprising that such simple policies canachieve optimality of the joint distribution of the age processes at all nodeseven under arbitrary network topologies, as well as arbitrary packet generationand arrival times. These optimality results not only hold for the ageprocesses, but also for any non-decreasing functional of the age processes.

Throughput-Delay Analysis of Random Linear Network Coding for Wireless  Broadcasting

  In an unreliable single-hop broadcast network setting, we investigate thethroughput and decoding-delay performance of random linear network coding as afunction of the coding window size and the network size. Our model consists ofa source transmitting packets of a single flow to a set of $n$ users overindependent erasure channels. The source performs random linear network coding(RLNC) over $k$ (coding window size) packets and broadcasts them to the users.We note that the broadcast throughput of RLNC must vanish with increasing $n$,for any fixed $k.$ Hence, in contrast to other works in the literature, weinvestigate how the coding window size $k$ must scale for increasing $n$. Ouranalysis reveals that the coding window size of $\Theta(\ln(n))$ represents aphase transition rate, below which the throughput converges to zero, and abovewhich it converges to the broadcast capacity. Further, we characterize theasymptotic distribution of decoding delay and provide approximate expressionsfor the mean and variance of decoding delay for the scaling regime of$k=\omega(\ln(n)).$ These asymptotic expressions reveal the impact of channelcorrelations on the throughput and delay performance of RLNC. We also show howour analysis can be extended to other rateless block coding schemes such as theLT codes. Finally, we comment on the extension of our results to the cases ofdependent channels across users and asymmetric channel model.

Delay-Based Back-Pressure Scheduling in Multihop Wireless Networks

  Scheduling is a critical and challenging resource allocation mechanism formultihop wireless networks. It is well known that scheduling schemes that favorlinks with larger queue length can achieve high throughput performance.However, these queue-length-based schemes could potentially suffer from large(even infinite) packet delays due to the well-known last packet problem,whereby packets belonging to some flows may be excessively delayed due to lackof subsequent packet arrivals. Delay-based schemes have the potential toresolve this last packet problem by scheduling the link based on the delay thepacket has encountered. However, characterizing throughput-optimality of thesedelay-based schemes has largely been an open problem in multihop wirelessnetworks (except in limited cases where the traffic is single-hop.) In thispaper, we investigate delay-based scheduling schemes for multihop trafficscenarios with fixed routes. We develop a scheduling scheme based on a newdelay metric, and show that the proposed scheme achieves optimal throughputperformance. Further, we conduct simulations to support our analytical results,and show that the delay-based scheduler successfully removes excessive packetdelays, while it achieves the same throughput region as the queue-length-basedscheme.

Throughput-optimal Scheduling in Multi-hop Wireless Networks without  Per-flow Information

  In this paper, we consider the problem of link scheduling in multi-hopwireless networks under general interference constraints. Our goal is to designscheduling schemes that do not use per-flow or per-destination information,maintain a single data queue for each link, and exploit only local information,while guaranteeing throughput optimality. Although the celebrated back-pressurealgorithm maximizes throughput, it requires per-flow or per-destinationinformation. It is usually difficult to obtain and maintain this type ofinformation, especially in large networks, where there are numerous flows.Also, the back-pressure algorithm maintains a complex data structure at eachnode, keeps exchanging queue length information among neighboring nodes, andcommonly results in poor delay performance. In this paper, we proposescheduling schemes that can circumvent these drawbacks and guarantee throughputoptimality. These schemes use either the readily available hop-countinformation or only the local information for each link. We rigorously analyzethe performance of the proposed schemes using fluid limit techniques via aninductive argument and show that they are throughput-optimal. We also conductsimulations to validate our theoretical results in various settings, and showthat the proposed schemes can substantially improve the delay performance inmost scenarios.

On the Critical Delays of Mobile Networks under Lévy Walks and  Lévy Flights

  Delay-capacity tradeoffs for mobile networks have been analyzed through anumber of research work. However, L\'{e}vy mobility known to closely capturehuman movement patterns has not been adopted in such work. Understanding thedelay-capacity tradeoff for a network with L\'{e}vy mobility can provideimportant insights into understanding the performance of real mobile networksgoverned by human mobility. This paper analytically derives an important pointin the delay-capacity tradeoff for L\'{e}vy mobility, known as the criticaldelay. The critical delay is the minimum delay required to achieve greaterthroughput than what conventional static networks can possibly achieve (i.e.,$O(1/\sqrt{n})$ per node in a network with $n$ nodes). The L\'{e}vy mobilityincludes L\'{e}vy flight and L\'{e}vy walk whose step size distributionsparametrized by $\alpha \in (0,2]$ are both heavy-tailed while their timestaken for the same step size are different. Our proposed technique involves (i)analyzing the joint spatio-temporal probability density function of atime-varying location of a node for L\'{e}vy flight and (ii) characterizing anembedded Markov process in L\'{e}vy walk which is a semi-Markov process. Theresults indicate that in L\'{e}vy walk, there is a phase transition such thatfor $\alpha \in (0,1)$, the critical delay is always $\Theta (n^{1/2})$ and for$\alpha \in [1,2]$ it is $\Theta(n^{\frac{\alpha}{2}})$. In contrast, L\'{e}vyflight has the critical delay $\Theta(n^{\frac{\alpha}{2}})$ for$\alpha\in(0,2]$.

Optimal Distributed Resource Allocation for Decode-and-Forward Relay  Networks

  This paper presents a distributed resource allocation algorithm to jointlyoptimize the power allocation, channel allocation and relay selection fordecode-and-forward (DF) relay networks with a large number of sources, relays,and destinations. The well-known dual decomposition technique cannot directlybe applied to resolve this problem, because the achievable data rate of DFrelaying is not strictly concave, and thus the local resource allocationsubproblem may have non-unique solutions. We resolve this non-strict concavityproblem by using the idea of the proximal point method, which adds quadraticterms to make the objective function strictly concave. However, the proximalsolution adds an extra layer of iterations over typical duality basedapproaches, which can significantly slow down the speed of convergence. Toaddress this key weakness, we devise a fast algorithm without the need for thisadditional layer of iterations, which converges to the optimal solution. Ouralgorithm only needs local information exchange, and can easily adapt tovariations of network size and topology. We prove that our distributed resourceallocation algorithm converges to the optimal solution. A channel resourceadjustment method is further developed to provide more channel resources to thebottleneck links and realize traffic load balance. Numerical results areprovided to illustrate the benefits of our algorithm.

Delay Asymptotics with Retransmissions and Incremental Redundancy Codes  over Erasure Channels

  Recent studies have shown that retransmissions can cause heavy-tailedtransmission delays even when packet sizes are light-tailed. Moreover, theimpact of heavy-tailed delays persists even when packets size are upperbounded. The key question we study in this paper is how the use of codingtechniques to transmit information, together with different systemconfigurations, would affect the distribution of delay. To investigate thisproblem, we model the underlying channel as a Markov modulated binary erasurechannel, where transmitted bits are either received successfully or erased.Erasure codes are used to encode information prior to transmission, whichensures that a fixed fraction of the bits in the codeword can lead tosuccessful decoding. We use incremental redundancy codes, where the codeword isdivided into codeword trunks and these trunks are transmitted one at a time toprovide incremental redundancies to the receiver until the information isrecovered. We characterize the distribution of delay under two differentscenarios: (I) Decoder uses memory to cache all previously successfullyreceived bits. (II) Decoder does not use memory, where received bits arediscarded if the corresponding information cannot be decoded. In both cases, weconsider codeword length with infinite and finite support. From a theoreticalperspective, our results provide a benchmark to quantify the tradeoff betweensystem complexity and the distribution of delay.

Capacity of Compound MIMO Gaussian Channels with Additive Uncertainty

  This paper considers reliable communications over a multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian channel, where the channel matrix is within abounded channel uncertainty region around a nominal channel matrix, i.e., aninstance of the compound MIMO Gaussian channel. We study the optimal transmitcovariance matrix design to achieve the capacity of compound MIMO Gaussianchannels, where the channel uncertainty region is characterized by the spectralnorm. This design problem is a challenging non-convex optimization problem.However, in this paper, we reveal that this problem has a hidden convexityproperty, which can be exploited to map the problem into a convex optimizationproblem. We first prove that the optimal transmit design is to diagonalize thenominal channel, and then show that the duality gap between the capacity of thecompound MIMO Gaussian channel and the min-max channel capacity is zero, whichproves the conjecture of Loyka and Charalambous (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol.58, no. 4, pp. 2048-2063, 2012). The key tools for showing these results are anew matrix determinant inequality and some unitarily invariant properties.

Distributed Cross-Layer Optimization in Wireless Networks: A  Second-Order Approach

  Due to the rapidly growing scale and heterogeneity of wireless networks, thedesign of distributed cross-layer optimization algorithms have receivedsignificant interest from the networking research community. So far, thestandard distributed cross-layer approach in the literature is based onfirst-order Lagrangian dual decomposition and the subgradient method, whichsuffers a slow convergence rate. In this paper, we make the first known attemptto develop a distributed Newton's method, which is second-order and enjoys aquadratic convergence rate. However, due to interference in wireless networks,the Hessian matrix of the cross-layer problem has an non-separable structure.As a result, developing a distributed second-order algorithm is far morechallenging than its counterpart for wireline networks. Our main results inthis paper are two-fold: i) For a special network setting where all linksmutually interfere, we derive decentralized closed-form expressions to computethe Hessian inverse; ii) For general wireless networks where the interferencerelationships are arbitrary, we propose a distributed iterative matrixsplitting scheme for the Hessian inverse. These results successfully lead to anew theoretical framework for cross-layer optimization in wireless networks.More importantly, our work contributes to an exciting second-order paradigmshift in wireless networks optimization theory.

On the Efficiency-vs-Security Tradeoff in the Smart Grid

  The smart grid is envisioned to significantly enhance the efficiency ofenergy consumption, by utilizing two-way communication channels betweenconsumers and operators. For example, operators can opportunistically leveragethe delay tolerance of energy demands in order to balance the energy load overtime, and hence, reduce the total operational cost. This opportunity, however,comes with security threats, as the grid becomes more vulnerable tocyber-attacks. In this paper, we study the impact of such maliciouscyber-attacks on the energy efficiency of the grid in a simplified setup. Moreprecisely, we consider a simple model where the energy demands of the smartgrid consumers are intercepted and altered by an active attacker before theyarrive at the operator, who is equipped with limited intrusion detectioncapabilities. We formulate the resulting optimization problems faced by theoperator and the attacker and propose several scheduling and attack strategiesfor both parties. Interestingly, our results show that, as opposed tofacilitating cost reduction in the smart grid, increasing the delay toleranceof the energy demands potentially allows the attacker to force increased costson the system. This highlights the need for carefully constructed and robustintrusion detection mechanisms at the operator.

Providing Probabilistic Guarantees on the Time of Information Spread in  Opportunistic Networks

  A variety of mathematical tools have been developed for predicting thespreading patterns in a number of varied environments including infectiousdiseases, computer viruses, and urgent messages broadcast to mobile agent(e.g., humans, vehicles, and mobile devices). These tools have mainly focusedon estimating the average time for the spread to reach a fraction (e.g.,$\alpha$) of the agents, i.e., the so-called average completion time$E(T_{\alpha})$. We claim that providing probabilistic guarantee on the timefor the spread $T_{\alpha}$ rather than only its average gives a much betterunderstanding of the spread, and hence could be used to design improved methodsto prevent epidemics or devise accelerated methods for distributing data. Todemonstrate the benefits, we introduce a new metric $G_{\alpha, \beta}$ thatdenotes the time required to guarantee $\alpha$ completion with probability$\beta$, and develop a new framework to characterize the distribution of$T_\alpha$ for various spread parameters such as number of seeds, level ofcontact rates, and heterogeneity in contact rates. We apply our technique to anexperimental mobility trace of taxies in Shanghai and show that our frameworkenables us to allocate resources (i.e., to control spread parameters) foracceleration of spread in a far more efficient way than the state-of-the-art.

Low-Complexity Scheduling Policies for Achieving Throughput and  Asymptotic Delay Optimality in Multi-Channel Wireless Networks

  In this paper, we study the scheduling problem for downlink transmission in amulti-channel (e.g., OFDM-based) wireless network. We focus on a single cell,with the aim of developing a unifying framework for designing low-complexityscheduling policies that can provide optimal performance in terms of boththroughput and delay. We develop new easy-to-verify sufficient conditions forrate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptoticregime) and throughput optimality (in general non-asymptotic setting),respectively. The sufficient conditions allow us to prove rate-function delayoptimality for a class of Oldest Packets First (OPF) policies and throughputoptimality for a large class of Maximum Weight in the Fluid limit (MWF)policies, respectively. By exploiting the special features of our carefullychosen sufficient conditions and intelligently combining policies from theclasses of OPF and MWF policies, we design hybrid policies that are bothrate-function delay-optimal and throughput-optimal with a complexity of$O(n^{2.5} \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of channels or users. Oursufficient condition is also used to show that a previously proposed policycalled Delay Weighted Matching (DWM) is rate-function delay-optimal. However,DWM incurs a high complexity of $O(n^5)$. Thus, our approach yieldssignificantly lower complexity than the only previously designed delay andthroughput optimal scheduling policy. We also conduct numerical experiments tovalidate our theoretical results.

Distributed Power Allocation for Coordinated Multipoint Transmissions in  Distributed Antenna Systems

  This paper investigates the distributed power allocation problem forcoordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmissions in distributed antenna systems(DAS). Traditional duality based optimization techniques cannot be directlyapplied to this problem, because the non-strict concavity of the CoMPtransmission's achievable rate with respect to the transmission power inducesthat the local power allocation subproblems have non-unique optimum solutions.We propose a distributed power allocation algorithm to resolve this non-strictconcavity difficulty. This algorithm only requires local information exchangeamong neighboring base stations serving the same user, and is thus scalable asthe network size grows. The step-size parameters of this algorithm aredetermined by only local user access relationship (i.e., the number of usersserved by each antenna), but do not rely on channel coefficients. Therefore,the convergence speed of this algorithm is quite robust to different channelfading coefficients. We rigorously prove that this algorithm converges to anoptimum solution of the power allocation problem. Simulation results arepresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power allocationalgorithm.

Scheduling in Time-correlated Wireless Networks with Imperfect CSI and  Stringent Constraint

  In a wireless network, the efficiency of scheduling algorithms overtime-varying channels depends heavily on the accuracy of the Channel StateInformation (CSI), which is usually quite ``costly'' in terms of consumingnetwork resources. Scheduling in such systems is also subject to stringentconstraints such as power and bandwidth, which limit the maximum number ofsimultaneous transmissions. In the meanwhile, communication channels inwireless systems typically fluctuate in a time-correlated manner. We hencedesign schedulers to exploit the temporal-correlation inherent in channels withmemory and ARQ-styled feedback from the users for better channel stateknowledge, under the assumption of Markovian channels and the stringentconstraint on the maximum number of simultaneously active users. We model thisproblem under the framework of a Partially Observable Markov DecisionProcesses.  In recent work, a low-complexity optimal solution was developed for thisproblem under a long-term time-average resource constraint. However, in realsystems with instantaneous resource constraints, how to optimally exploit thetemporal correlation and satisfy realistic stringent constraint on theinstantaneous service remains elusive. In this work, we incorporate a stringentconstraint on the simultaneously scheduled users and propose a low-complexityscheduling algorithm that dynamically implements user scheduling and dummypacket broadcasting. We show that the throughput region of the optimal policyunder the long-term average resource constraint can be asymptotically achievedin the stringent constrained scenario by the proposed algorithm, in the manyusers limiting regime.

Network Control without CSI using Rateless Codes for Downlink Cellular  Systems

  Wireless network scheduling and control techniques (e.g., opportunisticscheduling) rely heavily on access to Channel State Information (CSI). However,obtaining this information is costly in terms of bandwidth, time, and power,and could result in large overhead. Therefore, a critical question is how tooptimally manage network resources in the absence of such information. To thatend, we develop a cross-layer solution for downlink cellular systems withimperfect (and possibly no) CSI at the transmitter. We use rateless codes toresolve channel uncertainty. To keep the decoding complexity low, we explicitlyincorporate time-average block-size constraints, and aim to maximize the systemutility. The block-size of a rateless code is determined by both the networkcontrol decisions and the unknown CSI of many time slots. Therefore, unlikestandard utility maximization problems, this problem can be viewed as aconstrained partial observed Markov decision problem (CPOMDP), which is knownto be hard due to the "curse of dimensionality." However, by using a modifiedLyapunov drift method, we develop a dynamic network control scheme, whichyields a total network utility within O(1/Lav) of utility-optimal pointachieved by infinite block-size channel codes, where Lav is the enforced valueof the time-average block-size of rateless codes. This opens the door of beingable to trade complexity/delay for performance gains in the absence of accurateCSI. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the networkthroughput by up to 68% over schemes that use fixed-rate codes.

Provably Delay Efficient Data Retrieving in Storage Clouds

  One key requirement for storage clouds is to be able to retrieve dataquickly. Recent system measurements have shown that the data retrieving delayin storage clouds is highly variable, which may result in a long latency tail.One crucial idea to improve the delay performance is to retrieve multiple datacopies by using parallel downloading threads. However, how to optimallyschedule these downloading threads to minimize the data retrieving delayremains to be an important open problem. In this paper, we developlow-complexity thread scheduling policies for several important classes of datadownloading time distributions, and prove that these policies are eitherdelay-optimal or within a constant gap from the optimum delay performance.These theoretical results hold for an arbitrary arrival process of readrequests that may contain finite or infinite read requests, and forheterogeneous MDS storage codes that can support diverse storage redundancy andreliability requirements for different data files. Our numerical results showthat the delay performance of the proposed policies is significantly betterthan that of First-Come- First-Served (FCFS) policies considered in prior work.

The Impact of Stealthy Attacks on Smart Grid Performance: Tradeoffs and  Implications

  The smart grid is envisioned to significantly enhance the efficiency ofenergy consumption, by utilizing two-way communication channels betweenconsumers and operators. For example, operators can opportunistically leveragethe delay tolerance of energy demands in order to balance the energy load overtime, and hence, reduce the total operational cost.

This highlights the need for carefully constructed and robustintrusion detection mechanisms at the operator.

Defending Against Stealthy Attacks on Multiple Nodes with Limited  Resources: A Game-Theoretic Analysis

  Stealthy attacks are a major cyber-security threat. In practice, bothattackers and defenders have resource constraints that could limit theircapabilities. Hence, to develop robust defense strategies, a promising approachis to utilize game theory to understand the fundamental trade-offs involved.Previous works in this direction, however, mainly focus on the single-node casewithout considering strict resource constraints. In this paper, agame-theoretic model for protecting a system of multiple nodes against stealthyattacks is proposed. We consider the practical setting where the frequencies ofboth attack and defense are constrained by limited resources, and an asymmetricfeedback structure where the attacker can fully observe the states of nodeswhile largely hiding its actions from the defender. We characterize the bestresponse strategies for both attacker and defender in the space of bothnon-adaptive and adaptive strategies, and study the Nash Equilibria of thegame. We further study a sequential game where the defender first announces itsstrategy and the attacker then responds accordingly, and design an algorithmthat finds a nearly optimal strategy for the defender to commit to.

Achieving Delay Rate-function Optimality in OFDM Downlink with  Time-correlated Channels

  There have been recent attempts to develop scheduling schemes for downlinktransmission in a single cell of a multi-channel (e.g., OFDM-based) cellularnetwork. These works have been quite promising in that they have developedlow-complexity index scheduling policies that are delay-optimal (in a largedeviation rate-function sense). However, these policies require that thechannel is ON or OFF in each time-slot with a fixed probability (i.e., there isno memory in the system), while the reality is that due to channel fading anddoppler shift, channels are often time-correlated in these cellular systems.Thus, an important open question is whether one can find simple indexscheduling policies that are delay-optimal even when the channels aretime-correlated. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question fortime-correlated ON/OFF channels. In particular, we show that the class ofoldest packets first (OPF) policies that give a higher priority to packets witha large delay is delay rate-function optimal under two conditions: 1) Thechannel is non-negatively correlated, and 2) The distribution of the OFF periodis geometric. We use simulations to further elucidate the theoretical results.

Optimizing Data Freshness, Throughput, and Delay in Multi-Server  Information-Update Systems

  In this work, we investigate the design of information-update systems, whereincoming update packets are forwarded to a remote destination through multipleservers (each server can be viewed as a wireless channel). One importantperformance metric of these systems is the age-of-information or simply age,which is defined as the time elapsed since the freshest packet at thedestination was generated. Recent studies on information-update systems haveshown that the age-of-information can be reduced by intelligently droppingstale packets. However, packet dropping may not be appropriate in manyapplications, such as news and social updates, where users are interested innot just the latest updates, but also past news. Therefore, all packets mayneed to be successfully delivered. In this paper, we study how to optimizeage-of-information without throughput loss. We consider a general scenariowhere incoming update packets do not necessarily arrive in the order of theirgeneration times. We prove that a preemptive Last Generated First Served (LGFS)policy simultaneous optimizes the age, throughput, and delay performance ininfinite buffer queueing systems. We also show age-optimality for the LGFSpolicy for any finite queue size. These results hold for arbitrary, includingnon-stationary, arrival processes. To the best of our knowledge, this paperpresents the first optimal result on minimizing the age-of-information incommunication networks with an external arrival process of information updatepackets.

On Delay-Optimal Scheduling in Queueing Systems with Replications

  In modern computer systems, jobs are divided into short tasks and executed inparallel. Empirical observations in practical systems suggest that the taskservice times are highly random and the job service time is bottlenecked by theslowest straggling task. One common solution for straggler mitigation is toreplicate a task on multiple servers and wait for one replica of the task tofinish early. The delay performance of replications depends heavily on thescheduling decisions of when to replicate, which servers to replicate on, andwhich job to serve first. So far, little is understood on how to optimize thesescheduling decisions for minimizing the delay to complete the jobs. In thispaper, we present a comprehensive study on delay-optimal scheduling ofreplications in both centralized and distributed multi-server systems.Low-complexity scheduling policies are designed and are proven to bedelay-optimal or near delay-optimal in stochastic ordering among all causal andnon-preemptive policies. These theoretical results are established for generalsystem settings and delay metrics that allow for arbitrary arrival processes,arbitrary job sizes, arbitrary due times, and heterogeneous servers with datalocality constraints. Novel sample-path tools are developed to prove theseresults.

Delay-Optimal Buffer-Aware Scheduling with Adaptive Transmission

  In this work, we aim to obtain the optimal tradeoff between the average delayand the average power consumption in a communication system. In our system, thearrivals occur at each timeslot according to a Bernoulli arrival process andare buffered at the transmitter. The transmitter determines the schedulingpolicy of how many packets to transmit under an average power constraint. Thepower is assumed to be an increasing and convex function of the number ofpackets transmitted in each timeslot to capture the realism in communicationsystems. We also consider a finite buffer and allow the scheduling decision todepend on the buffer occupancy. This problem is modelled as a ConstrainedMarkov Decision Process (CMDP). We first prove that the optimal policy of the(Lagrangian) relaxation of the CMDP is deterministic and threshold-based. Wethen show that the optimal delay-power tradeoff curve is convex and piecewiselinear, where each of the vertices are obtained by the optimal solution to therelaxed problem. This allows us to show the optimal policies of the CMDP arethreshold-based, and hence can be implemented by a proposed efficientalgorithm. The theoretical results and the algorithm are validated by LinearProgramming and simulations.

When to Reset Your Keys: Optimal Timing of Security Updates via Learning

  Cybersecurity is increasingly threatened by advanced and persistent attacks.As these attacks are often designed to disable a system (or a criticalresource, e.g., a user account) repeatedly, it is crucial for the defender tokeep updating its security measures to strike a balance between the risk ofbeing compromised and the cost of security updates. Moreover, these decisionsoften need to be made with limited and delayed feedback due to the stealthynature of advanced attacks. In addition to targeted attacks, such an optimaltiming policy under incomplete information has broad applications incybersecurity. Examples include key rotation, password change, application ofpatches, and virtual machine refreshing. However, rigorous studies of optimaltiming are rare. Further, existing solutions typically rely on a pre-definedattack model that is known to the defender, which is often not the case inpractice. In this work, we make an initial effort towards achieving optimaltiming of security updates in the face of unknown stealthy attacks. We considera variant of the influential FlipIt game model with asymmetric feedback andunknown attack time distribution, which provides a general model to consecutivesecurity updates. The defender's problem is then modeled as a time associativebandit problem with dependent arms. We derive upper confidence bound basedlearning policies that achieve low regret compared with optimal periodicdefense strategies that can only be derived when attack time distributions areknown.

Dual Sub-6 GHz -- Millimeter Wave Beamforming and Communications to  Achieve Low Latency and High Energy Efficiency in 5G Systems

  We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates RF (i.e., sub-6 GHz) andmillimeter wave (mmWave) technologies for 5G cellular systems. In particular,communications in the mmWave band faces significant challenges due to variablechannels, intermittent connectivity, and high energy usage. On the other hand,speeds for electronic processing of data is of the same order as typical ratesfor mmWave interfaces which makes the use of complex algorithms for trackingchannel variations and adjusting resources accordingly impractical. Ourproposed architecture integrates the RF and mmWave interfaces for beamformingand data transfer, and exploits the spatio-temporal correlations between theinterfaces. Based on extensive experimentation in indoor and outdoor settings,we demonstrate that an integrated RF/mmWave signaling and channel estimationscheme can remedy the problem of high energy usage and delay associated withmmWave beamforming. In addition, cooperation between two interfaces at thehigher layers effectively addresses the high delays caused by highlyintermittent mmWave connectivity. We design a scheduler that fully exploits themmWave bandwidth, while the RF link acts as a fallback mechanism to preventhigh delay. To this end, we formulate an optimal scheduling problem over the RFand mmWave interfaces where the goal is to maximize the delay-constrainedthroughput of the mmWave interface. We prove using subadditivity analysis thatthe optimal scheduling policy is based on a single threshold that can be easilyadopted despite high link variations.

Reward Maximization Under Uncertainty: Leveraging Side-Observations on  Networks

  We study the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem in the presence ofside-observations across actions that occur as a result of an underlyingnetwork structure. In our model, a bipartite graph captures the relationshipbetween actions and a common set of unknowns such that choosing an actionreveals observations for the unknowns that it is connected to. This models acommon scenario in online social networks where users respond to their friends'activity, thus providing side information about each other's preferences. Ourcontributions are as follows: 1) We derive an asymptotic lower bound (withrespect to time) as a function of the bi-partite network structure on theregret of any uniformly good policy that achieves the maximum long-term averagereward. 2) We propose two policies - a randomized policy; and a policy based onthe well-known upper confidence bound (UCB) policies - both of which exploreeach action at a rate that is a function of its network position. We show,under mild assumptions, that these policies achieve the asymptotic lower boundon the regret up to a multiplicative factor, independent of the networkstructure. Finally, we use numerical examples on a real-world social networkand a routing example network to demonstrate the benefits obtained by ourpolicies over other existing policies.

Minimizing the Age of Information through Queues

  In this paper, we focus on developing simple scheduling policies that canminimize the age of the information sent through multi-server queueing systems.We consider a general packet arrival process, where the generation times andarrival times of the packets are arbitrary. Hence, the packets may arrive in anorder that is different from the order of their generation times. Further, apacket can be replicated on multiple servers, and one can specify a priori themaximum number of replicas that can be created for each packet. Once a replicais completed, the remaining replicas of this packet are canceled to release theservers. We prove that simple variants (e.g., preemptive, replicative,non-replicative) of the Last-Generated, First-Serve (LGFS) scheduling policyare age-optimal in a stochastic ordering sense for exponentially distributedpacket service times. These policies are optimal for minimizing not only theage process, but also for minimizing any non-decreasing functional of the ageprocess. We further investigate the class of New-Better-than-Used (NBU) servicetime distributions and develop scheduling policies that are shown to be withina constant gap from the optimum age performance. It is known that replicationworsens the delay and decreases the throughput for most NBU service timedistributions. However, to our surprise, we find that replication can in factreduce the age for a variety of NBU service time distributions. Our resultsfurther imply that the variants of Last-Come, First-Serve (LCFS) schedulingpolicies are (near) age-optimal, because they are special cases of the proposedLGFS-type policies.

Energy-Efficient Power and Bandwidth Allocation in an Integrated Sub-6  GHz -- Millimeter Wave System

  In mobile millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, energy is a scarce resource dueto the large losses in the channel and high energy usage by analog-to-digitalconverters (ADC), which scales with bandwidth. In this paper, we consider acommunication architecture that integrates the sub-6 GHz and mmWavetechnologies in 5G cellular systems. In order to mitigate the energy scarcityin mmWave systems, we investigate the rate-optimal and energy-efficientphysical layer resource allocation jointly across the sub-6 GHz and mmWaveinterfaces. First, we formulate an optimization problem in which the objectiveis to maximize the achievable sum rate under power constraints at thetransmitter and receiver. Our formulation explicitly takes into account theenergy consumption in integrated-circuit components, and assigns the optimalpower and bandwidth across the interfaces. We consider the settings with nochannel state information and partial channel state information at thetransmitter and under high and low SNR scenarios. Second, we investigate theenergy efficiency (EE) defined as the ratio between the amount of datatransmitted and the corresponding incurred cost in terms of power. We usefractional programming and Dinkelbach's algorithm to solve the EE optimizationproblem. Our results prove that despite the availability of huge bandwidths atthe mmWave interface, it may be optimal (in terms of achievable sum rate andenergy efficiency) to utilize it partially. Moreover, depending on the sub-6GHz and mmWave channel conditions and total power budget, it may be optimal toactivate only one of the interfaces.

Efficient Beam Alignment in Millimeter Wave Systems Using Contextual  Bandits

  In this paper, we investigate the problem of beam alignment in millimeterwave (mmWave) systems, and design an optimal algorithm to reduce the overhead.Specifically, due to directional communications, the transmitter and receiverbeams need to be aligned, which incurs high delay overhead since without apriori knowledge of the transmitter/receiver location, the search space spansthe entire angular domain. This is further exacerbated under dynamic conditions(e.g., moving vehicles) where the access to the base station (access point) ishighly dynamic with intermittent on-off periods, requiring more frequent beamalignment and signal training. To mitigate this issue, we consider an onlinestochastic optimization formulation where the goal is to maximize thedirectivity gain (i.e., received energy) of the beam alignment policy within atime period. We exploit the inherent correlation and unimodality properties ofthe model, and demonstrate that contextual information improves theperformance. To this end, we propose an equivalent structured Multi-ArmedBandit model to optimally exploit the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Incontrast to the classical MAB models, the contextual information makes thelower bound on regret (i.e., performance loss compared with an oracle policy)independent of the number of beams. This is a crucial property since the numberof all combinations of beam patterns can be large in transceiver antennaarrays, especially in massive MIMO systems. We further provide anasymptotically optimal beam alignment algorithm, and investigate itsperformance via simulations.

The Age of Information in Multihop Networks

  The problem of minimizing the age-of-information has been extensively studiedin single-hop networks. In this paper, we minimize the age of a singleinformation flow in multihop networks. If the packet transmission times overthe network links are exponentially distributed, we prove that a preemptiveLast-Generated, First-Serve (LGFS) policy results in smaller age processes atall nodes of the network (in a stochastic ordering sense) than any other causalpolicy. In addition, for arbitrary distributions of packet transmission times,the non-preemptive LGFS policy is shown to minimize the age processes at allnodes among all non-preemptive work-conserving policies (again in a stochasticordering sense). Interestingly, these simple policies can achieve optimality ofthe joint distribution of the age processes at all nodes even under arbitrarynetwork topologies, as well as arbitrary packet generation and arrival times.These optimality results not only hold for the age processes, but also for anynon-decreasing functional of the age processes. Finally, we investigate theclass of New-Better-than-Used (NBU) packet transmission time distributions andshow that the non-preemptive LGFS policy is within a constant age gap from theoptimum average age, and that the gap is independent of system parameters.

High Throughput Low Delay Wireless Multicast via Multi-Channel Moving  Window Codes

  A fundamental challenge in wireless multicast has been how to simultaneouslyachieve high-throughput and low-delay for reliably serving a large number ofusers. In this paper, we show how to harness substantial throughput and delaygains by exploiting multi-channel resources. We develop a new scheme calledMulti-Channel Moving Window Codes (MC-MWC) for multi-channel multi-sessionwireless multicast. The salient features of MC-MWC are three-fold. (i) Highthroughput: we show that MC-MWC achieves order-optimal throughput in themany-user many-channel asymptotic regime. Moreover, the number of channelsrequired by a conventional channel-allocation based scheme is shown to bedoubly-exponentially larger than that required by MC-MWC. (ii) Low delay: usinglarge deviations theory, we show that the delay of MC-MWC decreases linearlywith the number of channels, while the delay reduction of conventional schemesis no more than a finite constant. (iii) Low feedback overhead: the feedbackoverhead of MC-MWC is a constant that is independent of both the number ofreceivers in each session and the number of sessions in the network. Finally,our trace-driven simulation and numerical results validate the analyticalresults and show that the implementation complexity of MC-MWC is low.

PAC Ranking from Pairwise and Listwise Queries: Lower Bounds and Upper  Bounds

  This paper explores the adaptive (active) PAC (probably approximatelycorrect) top-$k$ ranking (i.e., top-$k$ item selection) and total rankingproblems from $l$-wise ($l\geq 2$) comparisons under the multinomial logit(MNL) model. By adaptively choosing sets to query and observing the noisyoutput of the most favored item of each query, we want to design rankingalgorithms that recover the top-$k$ or total ranking using as few queries aspossible. For the PAC top-$k$ ranking problem, we derive a lower bound on thesample complexity (aka number of queries), and propose an algorithm that issample-complexity-optimal up to an $O(\log(k+l)/\log{k})$ factor. When $l=2$(i.e., pairwise comparisons) or $l=O(poly(k))$, this algorithm matches thelower bound. For the PAC total ranking problem, we derive a tight lower bound,and propose an algorithm that matches the lower bound. When $l=2$, the MNLmodel reduces to the popular Plackett-Luce (PL) model. In this setting, ourresults still outperform the state-of-the-art both theoretically andnumerically. We also compare our algorithms with the state-of-the-art usingsynthetic data as well as real-world data to verify the efficiency of ouralgorithms.

Simulated Annealing for Optimal Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks  with ImperfectCommunications

  Simulated annealing (SA) method has had significant recent success indesigning distributed control algorithms for wireless networks. These SA basedtechniques formed the basis of new CSMA algorithms and gave rise to thedevelopment of numerous variants to achieve the best system performanceaccommodating different communication technologies and more realistic systemconditions. However, these algorithms do not readily extend to networks withnoisy environments, as unreliable communication prevents them from gatheringthe necessary system state information needed to execute the algorithm. Inrecognition of this challenge, we propose a new SA algorithm that is designedto work more robustly in networks with communications that experience frequentmessage drops. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is a novel couplingtechnique that takes into account the external randomness of message passingfailure events as a part of probabilistic uncertainty inherent in stochasticacceptance criterion of SA. As a result, the algorithm can be executed evenwith partial observation of system states, which was not possible under thetraditional SA approach. We show that the newly proposed algorithm finds theoptimal solution almost surely under the standard annealing framework whileoffering significant performance benefits in terms of its computational speedin the presence of frequent message drops.

Age-optimal Sampling and Transmission Scheduling in Multi-Source Systems

  In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the age of informationin a multi-source system, where sources communicate their update packets to adestination via a channel with random delay. Due to interference, only onesource can be scheduled at a time. We consider the problem of finding adecision policy that controls the packet sampling times and schedules sourcetransmissions to minimize the total average peak age (TaPA) and the totalaverage age (TaA) of the sources. Our investigation of this problem results inan important separation principle: The optimal scheduling strategy and theoptimal sampling strategy are independent of each other. In particular, weprove that, given the sampling times of the update packets, the Maximum AgeFirst (MAF) scheduling strategy provides the best age performance among allscheduling strategies. This transforms our overall optimization problem into anoptimal sampling problem, given that the decision policy follows the MAFscheduling strategy. Interestingly, we show that the zero-wait sampler (inwhich a packet is generated once the channel is idle) is optimal for minimizingthe TaPA, while it does not always minimize the TaA. We use Dynamic Programming(DP) to investigate the optimal sampler for minimizing the TaA. Finally, weprovide an approximate analysis of Bellman's equation to approximate theTaA-optimal sampler by a water-filling solution and demonstrate its efficacythrough numerical evaluations.

Integrating Sub-6 GHz and Millimeter Wave to Combat Blockage:  Delay-Optimal Scheduling

  Millimeter wave (mmWave) technologies have the potential to achieve very highdata rates, but suffer from intermittent connectivity. In this paper, weprovision an architecture to integrate sub-6 GHz and mmWave technologies, wherewe incorporate the sub-6 GHz interface as a fallback data transfer mechanism tocombat blockage and intermittent connectivity of the mmWave communications. Tothis end, we investigate the problem of scheduling data packets across themmWave and sub-6 GHz interfaces such that the average delay of system isminimized. This problem can be formulated as Markov Decision Process. We firstinvestigate the problem of discounted delay minimization, and prove that theoptimal policy is of the threshold-type, i.e., data packets should always berouted to the mmWave interface as long as the number of packets in the systemis smaller than a threshold. Then, we show that the results of the discounteddelay problem hold for the average delay problem as well. Through numericalresults, we demonstrate that under heavy traffic, integrating sub-6 GHz withmmWave can reduce the average delay by up to 70%. Further, our schedulingpolicy substantially reduces the delay over the celebrated MaxWeight policy.

Achieving Optimal Throughput and Near-Optimal Asymptotic Delay  Performance in Multi-Channel Wireless Networks with Low Complexity: A  Practical Greedy Scheduling Policy

  In this paper, we focus on the scheduling problem in multi-channel wirelessnetworks, e.g., the downlink of a single cell in fourth generation (4G)OFDM-based cellular networks. Our goal is to design practical schedulingpolicies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both throughputand delay, at a low complexity. While a class of $O(n^{2.5} \log n)$-complexityhybrid scheduling policies are recently developed to guarantee bothrate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptoticregime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting),their practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we developa simple greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a\lower complexity $2n^2+2n$, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achievesthroughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal asymptotic delayperformance. Specifically, we show that the rate-function attained by D-SSG forany delay-violation threshold $b$, is no smaller than the maximum achievablerate-function by any scheduling policy for threshold $b-1$. Thus, we are ableto achieve a reduction in complexity (from $O(n^{2.5} \log n)$ of the hybridpolicies to $2n^2 + 2n$) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. Moreimportantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexitythan the hybrid policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden inthe $O(\cdot)$ notation. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to validateour theoretical results in various scenarios. The simulation results show thatD-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also empirically isvirtually indistinguishable from delay-optimal policies.

Multiuser Scheduling in a Markov-modeled Downlink using Randomly Delayed  ARQ Feedback

  We focus on the downlink of a cellular system, which corresponds to the bulkof the data transfer in such wireless systems. We address the problem ofopportunistic multiuser scheduling under imperfect channel state information,by exploiting the memory inherent in the channel. In our setting, the channelbetween the base station and each user is modeled by a two-state Markov chainand the scheduled user sends back an ARQ feedback signal that arrives at thescheduler with a random delay that is i.i.d across users and time. Thescheduler indirectly estimates the channel via accumulated delayed-ARQ feedbackand uses this information to make scheduling decisions. We formulate athroughput maximization problem as a partially observable Markov decisionprocess (POMDP). For the case of two users in the system, we show that a greedypolicy is sum throughput optimal for any distribution on the ARQ feedbackdelay. For the case of more than two users, we prove that the greedy policy issuboptimal and demonstrate, via numerical studies, that it has near optimalperformance. We show that the greedy policy can be implemented by a simplealgorithm that does not require the statistics of the underlying Markov channelor the ARQ feedback delay, thus making it robust against errors in systemparameter estimation. Establishing an equivalence between the two-user systemand a genie-aided system, we obtain a simple closed form expression for the sumcapacity of the Markov-modeled downlink. We further derive inner and outerbounds on the capacity region of the Markov-modeled downlink and tighten thesebounds for special cases of the system parameters.

Exploiting Channel Memory for Joint Estimation and Scheduling in  Downlink Networks

  We address the problem of opportunistic multiuser scheduling in downlinknetworks with Markov-modeled outage channels. We consider the scenario in whichthe scheduler does not have full knowledge of the channel state information,but instead estimates the channel state information by exploiting the memoryinherent in the Markov channels along with ARQ-styled feedback from thescheduled users. Opportunistic scheduling is optimized in two stages: (1)Channel estimation and rate adaptation to maximize the expected immediate rateof the scheduled user; (2) User scheduling, based on the optimized immediaterate, to maximize the overall long term sum-throughput of the downlink. Thescheduling problem is a partially observable Markov decision process with theclassic 'exploitation vs exploration' trade-off that is difficult to quantify.We therefore study the problem in the framework of Restless Multi-armed BanditProcesses (RMBP) and perform a Whittle's indexability analysis. Whittle'sindexability is traditionally known to be hard to establish and the indexpolicy derived based on Whittle's indexability is known to have optimalityproperties in various settings. We show that the problem of downlink schedulingunder imperfect channel state information is Whittle indexable and derive theWhittle's index policy in closed form. Via extensive numerical experiments, weshow that the index policy has near-optimal performance.  Our work reveals that, under incomplete channel state information, exploitingchannel memory for opportunistic scheduling can result in significantperformance gains and that almost all of these gains can be realized using aneasy-to-implement index policy.

Downlink Scheduling over Markovian Fading Channels

  We consider the scheduling problem in downlink wireless networks withheterogeneous, Markov-modulated, ON/OFF channels. It is well-known that theperformance of scheduling over fading channels relies heavily on the accuracyof the available Channel State Information (CSI), which is costly to acquire.Thus, we consider the CSI acquisition via a practical ARQ-based feedbackmechanism whereby channel states are revealed at the end of only scheduledusers' transmissions. In the assumed presence of temporally-correlated channelevolutions, the desired scheduler must optimally balance theexploitation-exploration trade-off, whereby it schedules transmissions both toexploit those channels with up-to-date CSI and to explore the current state ofthose with outdated CSI.  In earlier works, Whittle's Index Policy had been suggested as alow-complexity and high-performance solution to this problem. However,analyzing its performance in the typical scenario of statisticallyheterogeneous channel state processes has remained elusive and challenging,mainly because of the highly-coupled and complex dynamics it possesses. In thiswork, we overcome these difficulties to rigorously establish the asymptoticoptimality properties of Whittle's Index Policy in the limiting regime of manyusers. More specifically: (1) we prove the local optimality of Whittle's IndexPolicy, provided that the initial state of the system is within a certainneighborhood of a carefully selected state; (2) we then establish the globaloptimality of Whittle's Index Policy under a recurrence assumption that isverified numerically for our problem. These results establish that Whittle'sIndex Policy possesses analytically provable optimality characteristics forscheduling over heterogeneous and temporally-correlated channels.
