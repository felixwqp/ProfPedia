Fluctuation-dissipation ratios in the dynamics of self-assembly

  We consider two seemingly very different self-assembly processes: formationof viral capsids, and crystallization of sticky discs. At low temperatures,assembly is ineffective, since there are many metastable disordered states,which are a source of kinetic frustration. We use fluctuation-dissipationratios to extract information about the degree of this frustration. We showthat our analysis is a useful indicator of the long term fate of the system,based on the early stages of assembly.

A Comprehensive Search for Low-Energy Lines in BATSE GRBs

  A computer-based technique has been developed to search bright BATSEgamma-ray bursts for spectral lines in a comprehensive manner. The firstresults of the search are discussed and an example line candidate shown.

Complex optimal transport and the pluripotential theory of  Kähler-Ricci solitons

  Let (X,L) be a (semi-) polarized complex projective variety and T a realtorus acting holomorphically on X with moment polytope P. Given a probabilitydensity g on P we introduce a new type of Monge-Ampere measure on X, definedfor singular T-invariant metrics on the line bundle L, generalizing theordinary Monge-Ampere of global pluripotential theory, which corresponds to thecase when T is trivial (or g=1). In the opposite extreme case when T hasmaximal rank, i.e. (X,L,T) is a toric variety, the solution of thecorresponding Monge-Ampere equation with right hand side \mu corresponds to theconvex Kantorovich potential for the optimal transport map in theMonge-Kantorovich transport problem betweeen \mu and g (for a quadratic costfunction). Accordingly, our general setting can be seen as a complex version ofoptimal transport theory. Our main complex geometric applications concern thepluripotential study of singular (shrinking) Kahler-Ricci solitons. Inparticular, we establish the uniqueness of such solitons, modulo automorphisms,and explore their relation to a notion of modified K-stability inspired by thework of Tian-Zhu. The quantization of this setup, in the sense of Donaldson, isalso studied.

A vanishing theorem for weight one syzygies

  Inspired by the methods of Voisin, the first two authors recently proved thatone could read off the gonality of a curve C from the syzygies of its ideal inany one embedding of sufficiently large degree. This was deduced from from avanishing theorem for the asymptotic syzygies associated to an arbitrary linebundle B on C. The present paper extends this vanishing theorem to a smoothprojective variety X of arbitrary dimension. Specifically, given a line bundleB on X, we prove that if B is p-jet very ample (i.e. the sections of B separatejets of total weight p+1) then the weight one Koszul cohomology groupK_{p,1}(X, B; L) vanishes for all sufficiently positive L. In the otherdirection, we show that if there is a reduced cycle of length p+1 that fails toimpose independent conditions on sections of B, then the Koszul group inquestion is non-zero for very positive L.

Negative differential mobility of weakly driven particles in models of  glass formers

  We study the response of probe particles to weak constant driving inkinetically constrained models of glassy systems, and show that the probe'sresponse can be non-monotonic and give rise to negative differential mobility:increasing the applied force can reduce the probe's drift velocity in the forcedirection. Oth er significant non-linear effects are also demonstrated, such asthe enhancement with increasing force of the probe's fluctuations away from theaverage path, a phenomenon known in other contexts as giant diffusivity. Weshow that these res ults can be explained analytically by a continuous-timerandom walk approximatio n where there is decoupling between persistence andexchange times for local dis placements of the probe. This decoupling is due todynamic heterogeneity in the glassy system, which also leads to bimodaldistributions of probe particle disp lacements. We discuss the relevance of ourresults to experiments.

Convergence of Bergman measures for high powers of a line bundle

  Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on a compact complex manifold $X$ ofdimension $n,$ and let $e^{-\phi}$ be a continuous metric on $L.$ Fixing ameasure $d\mu$ on $X$ gives a sequence of Hilbert spaces consisting ofholomorphic sections of tensor powers of $L.$ We prove that the correspondingsequence of scaled Bergman measures converges, in the high tensor power limit,to the equilibrium measure of the pair $(K,\phi),$ where $K$ is the support of$d\mu,$ as long as $d\mu$ is stably Bernstein-Markov with respect to$(K,\phi).$ Here the Bergman measure denotes $d\mu$ times the restriction tothe diagonal of the pointwise norm of the corresponding orthogonal projectionoperator. In particular, an extension to higher dimensions is obtained ofresults concerning random matrices and classical orthogonal polynomials.

Global dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensation for a model of the  Kompaneets equation

  The Kompaneets equation describes a field of photons exchanging energy byCompton scattering with the free electrons of a homogeneous, isotropic,non-relativistic, thermal plasma. This paper strives to advance ourunderstanding of how this equation captures the phenomenon of Bose-Einsteincondensation through the study of a model equation. For this model we proveexistence and uniqueness theorems for global weak solutions. In some cases aBose-Einstein condensate will form in finite time, and we show that it willcontinue to gain photons forever afterwards. Moreover we show that everysolution approaches a stationary solution for large time. Key tools include auniversal super solution, a one-sided Oleinik type inequality, and an $L^1$contraction.

New Clock Comparison Searches for Lorentz and CPT Violation

  We present two new measurements constraining Lorentz and CPT violation usingthe Xe-129 / He-3 Zeeman maser and atomic hydrogen masers. Experimentalinvestigations of Lorentz and CPT symmetry provide important tests of theframework of the standard model of particle physics and theories of gravity.The two-species Xe-129 / He-3 Zeeman maser bounds violations of CPT and Lorentzsymmetry of the neutron at the 10^-31 GeV level. Measurements with atomichydrogen masers provide a clean limit of CPT and Lorentz symmetry violation ofthe proton at the 10^-27 GeV level.

Suppression of Reabsorption via Modulation of Light

  Reabsorption, the multiple scattering of spontaneously emitted photons inoptically thick gases, is a major limitation to efficient optical pumping andlaser cooling in ultracold gases. We report mitigation of reabsorption usingspatial and frequency modulation of laser light illuminating such gases. Wedeveloped a semi-classical model that successfully describes the reabsorptionprocess when frequency-modulated light is present. It was necessary to extendthe treatment in the model beyond a simple two-atom picture in order toreproduce our experimental results.

Hyperentangled States

  We investigate a new class of entangled states, which we call'hyperentangled',that have EPR correlations identical to those in the vacuumstate of a relativistic quantum field. We show that whenever hyperentangledstates exist in any quantum theory, they are dense in its state space. We alsogive prescriptions for constructing hyperentangled states that involve anarbitrarily large collection of systems.

PDE approximation of large systems of differential equations

  A large system of ordinary differential equations is approximated by aparabolic partial differential equation with dynamic boundary condition and adifferent one with Robin boundary condition. Using the theory of differentialoperators with Wentzell boundary conditions and similar theories, we giveestimates on the order of approximation. The theory is demonstrated on a votermodel where the Fourier method applied to the PDE is of great advantage.

Monte Carlo Studies of the Orientational Order-Disorder Phase Transition  in Solid Ammonium Chloride

  Monte Carlo methods are used to study the phase transition in ammoniumchloride from the orientationally ordered $\delta$ phase to the orientationallydisordered $\gamma$ phase. An effective pair potential is used to model theinteraction between ions. Thermodynamic properties are computed in thecanonical and isothermal-isobaric ensembles. Each ammonium ion is treated as arigidly rotating body and the lattice is fixed in the low-temperature CsClgeometry. A simple extension of the Metropolis Monte Carlo method is used toovercome quasiergodicity in the rotational sampling. In the constant-$NVT$calculations the lattice is held rigid; in the constant-$NpT$ calculations thelattice parameter is allowed to fluctuate. In both ensembles the orderparameter rapidly falls to zero in the range (200 - 250)K, suggesting that themodel disorders at a temperature in fair agreement with the experimentaldisordering temperature (243K). Peaks in the heat capacity and thermalexpansivity curves are also found in the same temperature range.

Computational Study of the Structure and Thermodynamic Properties of  Ammonium Chloride Clusters Using a Parallel J-Walking Approach

  The thermodynamic and structural properties of (NH$_4$Cl)$_n$ clusters,n=3-10 are studied. Using the method of simulated annealing, the geometries ofseveral isomers for each cluster size are examined. Jump-walking Monte Carlosimulations are then used to compute the constant-volume heat capacity for eachcluster size over a wide temperature range. To carry out these simulations anew parallel algorithm is developed using the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM)software package. Features of the cluster potential energy surfaces, such asenergy differences among isomers and rotational barriers of the ammonium ions,are found to play important roles in determining the shape of the heat capacitycurves.

Magnetic and lattice coupling in single-crystal SrFe$_2$As$_2$: A  neutron scattering study

  A detailed elastic neutron scattering study of the structural and magneticphase transitions in single-crystal SrFe$_2$As$_2$ reveals that theorthorhombic (O)-tetragonal (T) and the antiferromagnetic transitions coincideat $T_\texttt{O}$ = $T_\texttt{N}$ = (201.5 $\pm$ 0.25) K. The observation ofcoexisting O-T phases over a finite temperature range at the transition and thesudden onset of the O distortion provide strong evidences that the structuraltransition is first order. The simultaneous appearance and disappearance within0.5 K upon cooling and within 0.25 K upon warming, respectively, indicate thatthe magnetic and structural transitions are intimately coupled. We find thatthe hysteresis in the transition temperature extends over a 1-2 K range. Basedon the observation of a remnant orthorhombic phase at temperatures higher than\emph{T}$_\texttt{O}$, we suggest that the T-O transition may be anorder-disorder transition.

Broadband reduction of quantum radiation pressure noise via squeezed  light injection

  We present the reduction and manipulation of quantum radiation pressure noise(QRPN) in an optomechanical cavity with the injection of squeezed light. Theoptomechanical system consists of a high-reflectivity single-crystalmicroresonator which serves as one mirror of a Fabry-Perot cavity. Theexperiment is performed at room temperature and is QRPN dominated between 10kHz and 50 kHz, frequencies relevant to gravitational wave observatories. Weobserved a reduction of 1.2 dB in the measurement noise floor with theinjection of amplitude squeezed light generated from a below-thresholddegenerate optical parametric oscillator. This experiment is a crucial step inrealizing the reduction of QRPN for future interferometric gravitational wavedetectors and improving their sensitivity.

A Brown Dwarf Census from the SIMP Survey

  We have conducted a near-infrared (NIR) proper motion survey, the SondageInfrarouge de Mouvement Propre, in order to discover field ultracool dwarfs(UCD) in the solar neighborhood. The survey was conducted by imaging $\sim28\%$of the sky with the Cam\'era PAnoramique Proche-InfraRouge both in the southernhemisphere at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 1.5 m telescope, andin the northern hemisphere at the Observatoire du Mont-M\'egantic 1.6 mtelescope and comparing the source positions from these observations with theTwo Micron All-Sky Survey Point Source Catalog (2MASS PSC). Additional colorcriteria were used to further discriminate unwanted astrophysical sources. Wepresent the results of an NIR spectroscopic follow-up of 169 M, L, and Tdwarfs. Among the sources discovered are 2 young field brown dwarfs, 6unusually red M and L dwarfs, 25 unusually blue M and L dwarfs, 2 candidateunresolved L+T binaries, and 24 peculiar UCDs. Additionally, we add 9 L/Ttransition dwarfs (L6--T4.5) to the already known objects.

Glassy behaviour in an exactly solved spin system with a ferromagnetic  transition

  We show that applying simple dynamical rules to Baxter's eight-vertex modelleads to a system which resembles a glass-forming liquid. There are analogieswith liquid, supercooled liquid, glassy and crystalline states. The disorderedphases exhibit strong dynamical heterogeneity at low temperatures, which may bedescribed in terms of an emergent mobility field. Their dynamics arewell-described by a simple model with trivial thermodynamics, but an emergentkinetic constraint. We show that the (second order) thermodynamic transition tothe ordered phase may be interpreted in terms of confinement of the excitationsin the mobility field. We also describe the aging of disordered states towardsthe ordered phase, in terms of simple rate equations.

Space-time thermodynamics and subsystem observables in a kinetically  constrained model of glassy systems

  In a recent article [M. Merolle et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102, 10837(2005)] it was argued that dynamic heterogeneity in $d$-dimensional glassformers is a manifestation of an order-disorder phenomenon in the $d+1$dimensions of spacetime. By considering a dynamical analogue of the freeenergy, evidence was found for phase coexistence between active and inactiveregions of spacetime, and it was suggested that this phenomenon underlies theglass transition. Here we develop these ideas further by investigating indetail the one-dimensional Fredrickson-Andersen (FA) model in which the activeand inactive phases originate in the reducibility of the dynamics. Weillustrate the phase coexistence by considering the distributions of mesoscopicspacetime observables. We show how the analogy with phase coexistence can bestrengthened by breaking microscopic reversibility in the FA model, leading toa non-equilibrium theory in the directed percolation universality class.

Electron impact ionization loading of a surface electrode ion trap

  We demonstrate a method for loading surface electrode ion traps by electronimpact ionization. The method relies on the property of surface electrodegeometries that the trap depth can be increased at the cost of moremicromotion. By introducing a buffer gas, we can counteract the rf heatingassocated with the micromotion and benefit from the larger trap depth. After aninitial loading of the trap, standard compensation techniques can be used tocancel the stray fields resulting from charged dielectric and allow for theloading of the trap at ultra-high vacuum.

Finite-temperature critical point of a glass transition

  We generalize the simplest kinetically constrained model of a glass-formingliquid by softening kinetic constraints, allowing them to be violated with asmall finite rate. We demonstrate that this model supports a first-orderdynamical (space-time) phase transition, similar to those observed with hardconstraints. In addition, we find that the first-order phase boundary in thissoftened model ends in a finite-temperature dynamical critical point, which weexpect to be present in natural systems. We discuss links between this criticalpoint and quantum phase transitions, showing that dynamical phase transitionsin $d$ dimensions map to quantum transitions in the same dimension, and henceto classical thermodynamic phase transitions in $d+1$ dimensions. We make theselinks explicit through exact mappings between master operators, transfermatrices, and Hamiltonians for quantum spin chains.

MalStone: Towards A Benchmark for Analytics on Large Data Clouds

  Developing data mining algorithms that are suitable for cloud computingplatforms is currently an active area of research, as is developing cloudcomputing platforms appropriate for data mining. Currently, the most commonbenchmark for cloud computing is the Terasort (and related) benchmarks.Although the Terasort Benchmark is quite useful, it was not designed for datamining per se. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark called MalStone that isspecifically designed to measure the performance of cloud computing middlewarethat supports the type of data intensive computing common when building datamining models. We also introduce MalGen, which is a utility for generating dataon clouds that can be used with MalStone.

Extended Depth of Field for High Resolution Scanning Transmission  Electron Microscopy

  Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM)provide sub-angstrom lateral resolution; however, the large convergence anglegreatly reduces the depth of field. For microscopes with a small depth offield, information outside of the focal plane quickly becomes blurred and lessdefined. It may not be possible to image some samples entirely in focus.Extended depth-of-field techniques, however, allow a single image, with allareas in-focus, to be extracted from a series of images focused at a range ofdepths. In recent years, a variety of algorithmic approaches have been employedfor bright field optical microscopy. Here, we demonstrate that some establishedoptical microscopy methods can also be applied to extend the ~6 nm depth offocus of a 100 kV 5th-order aberration-corrected STEM (alpha_max = 33 mrad) toimage Pt-Co nanoparticles on a thick vulcanized carbon support. Thesetechniques allow us to automatically obtain a single image with all theparticles in focus as well as a complimentary topography map.

Preparation and relaxation of very stable glassy states of a simulated  liquid

  We prepare metastable glassy states in a model glass-former made ofLennard-Jones particles by sampling biased ensembles of trajectories with lowdynamical activity. These trajectories form an inactive dynamical phase whose`fast' vibrational degrees of freedom are maintained at thermal equilibrium bycontact with a heat bath, while the `slow' structural degrees of freedom arelocated in deep valleys of the energy landscape. We examine the relaxation toequilibrium and the vibrational properties of these metastable states. Theglassy states we prepare by our trajectory sampling method are very stable tothermal fluctuations and also more mechanically rigid than low-temperatureequilibrated configurations.

Data Processing For Atomic Resolution EELS

  The high beam current and sub-angstrom resolution of aberration-correctedscanning transmission electron microscopes has enabled electron energy lossspectroscopic (EELS) mapping with atomic resolution. These spectral maps areoften dose-limited and spatially oversampled, leading to low counts/channel andare thus highly sensitive to errors in background estimation. However, bytaking advantage of redundancy in the dataset map one can improve backgroundestimation and increase chemical sensitivity. We consider two such approaches-linear combination of power laws and local background averaging-that reducebackground error and improve signal extraction. Principal components analysis(PCA) can also be used to analyze spectrum images, but the poorpeak-to-background ratio in EELS can lead to serious artifacts if raw EELS datais PCA filtered. We identify common artifacts and discuss alternativeapproaches. These algorithms are implemented within the Cornell SpectrumImager, an open source software package for spectroscopic analysis.

Non-contact hemodynamic imaging reveals the jugular venous pulse  waveform

  Cardiovascular monitoring is important to prevent diseases from progressing.The jugular venous pulse (JVP) waveform offers important clinical informationabout cardiac health, but is not routinely examined due to its invasivecatheterisation procedure. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the JVPcan be consistently observed in a non-contact manner using a novel light-basedphotoplethysmographic imaging system, coded hemodynamic imaging (CHI). Whiletraditional monitoring methods measure the JVP at a single location, CHI'swide-field imaging capabilities were able to observe the jugular venous pulse'sspatial flow profile for the first time. The important inflection points in theJVP were observed, meaning that cardiac abnormalities can be assessed throughJVP distortions. CHI provides a new way to assess cardiac health throughnon-contact light-based JVP monitoring, and can be used in non-surgicalenvironments for cardiac assessment.

Interactive Learning from Policy-Dependent Human Feedback

  For agents and robots to become more useful, they must be able to quicklylearn from non-technical users. This paper investigates the problem ofinteractively learning behaviors communicated by a human teacher using positiveand negative feedback. Much previous work on this problem has made theassumption that people provide feedback for decisions that is dependent on thebehavior they are teaching and is independent from the learner's currentpolicy. We present empirical results that show this assumption to befalse---whether human trainers give a positive or negative feedback for adecision is influenced by the learner's current policy. We argue thatpolicy-dependent feedback, in addition to being commonplace, enables usefultraining strategies from which agents should benefit. Based on this insight, weintroduce Convergent Actor-Critic by Humans (COACH), an algorithm for learningfrom policy-dependent feedback that converges to a local optimum. Finally, wedemonstrate that COACH can successfully learn multiple behaviors on a physicalrobot, even with noisy image features.

QCD and Hadron Physics

  This document presents the recommendations and scientific conclusions fromthe Town Meeting on QCD and Hadronic Physics that took place in the period13-15 September 2014 at Temple University as part of the NSAC 2014 Long RangePlanning process. It highlights progress in hadron physics in the seven yearssince the 2007 Long Range Plan (LRP07), and presents a vision for the future byidentifying key questions and plausible paths to solutions which should defineour next decade. In defining the priority of outstanding physics opportunitiesfor the future, both prospects for the short (roughly 5 years) and longer term(beyond 10 years) are identified together with the facilities, personnel andother resources needed to maximize the discovery potential in hadronic physicsworldwide. In this connection, the potential of an electron ion collider ishighlighted.

A Close Companion Search around L Dwarfs using Aperture Masking  Interferometry and Palomar Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics

  We present a close companion search around sixteen known early-L dwarfs usingaperture masking interferometry with Palomar laser guide star adaptive optics.The use of aperture masking allows the detection of close binaries,corresponding to projected physical separations of 0.6-10.0 AU for the targetsof our survey. This survey achieved median contrast limits of Delta_K ~ 2.3 forseparations between 1.2 - 4 lambda/D, and Delta_K ~ 1.4 at (2/3)lambda/D.  We present four candidate binaries detected with moderate to high confidence(90-98%). Two have projected physical separations less than 1.5 AU. This mayindicate that tight-separation binaries contribute more significantly to thebinary fraction than currently assumed, consistent with spectroscopic andphotometric overluminosity studies.  Ten targets of this survey have previously been observed with the HubbleSpace Telescope as part of companion searches. We use the increased resolutionof aperture masking to search for close or dim companions that would beobscured by full aperture imaging, finding two candidate binaries.  This survey is the first application of aperture masking with laser guidestar adaptive optics at Palomar. Several new techniques for the analysis ofaperture masking data in the low signal to noise regime are explored.

The First FIRST Gravitationally Lensed Quasar: FBQ 0951+2635

  The V=16.9 quasar FBQ 0951+2635 at redshift z=1.24 appears double on CCDexposures taken in subarcsecond seeing. The two objects are separated by 1.1"and differ in brightness by 0.9 mag. VLA observations show the radio source tobe double with the same separation and position angle. Spectra taken with theKeck II telescope show the two components to have nearly identical emissionline spectra, but with somewhat different absorption line systems. Subtractionof two stellar point spread functions from the pair of components consistentlyleaves a residual object. Depending upon whether this third object is extendedor a point source it may be as much as 1/10 or as little as 1/100 as bright asthe brighter QSO component. The observations leave no doubt that the 2 brighterobjects are gravitationally lensed images of the same quasar. The third objectmight be either the lensing galaxy or a third image of the quasar, but bothinterpretations have serious shortcomings.

On the Near-Infrared Size of Vega

  Near-infrared (2.2 um) long baseline interferometric observations of Vega arepresented. The stellar disk of the star has been resolved, and the data havebeen fitted with a limb darkened stellar disk of diameter Theta_{LD} = 3.28 +/-0.01 mas. The derived effective temperature is T_eff = 9553 +/- 111 K. However,the residuals resulting from the stellar disk model appear to be significantand display organized structure. Instrumental artifacts, stellar surfacestructure, stellar atmosphere structure, and extended emission/scattering fromthe debris disk are discussed as possible sources of the residuals. While thecurrent dataset cannot uniquely determine the origin of the residuals, thedebris disk is found to be the most likely source. A simple debris disk model,with 3-6% of Vega's flux emanating from the disk at r < 4 AU, can explain theresiduals.

The Butcher-Oemler Effect in High Redshift X-ray Selected Clusters

  We are engaged in a wide-field, multi-colour imaging survey of X-ray selectedclusters at intermediate and high redshift. We present blue fractions for thefirst 8 out of 29 clusters, covering almost a factor of 100 in X-rayluminosity. We find no correlation of blue fraction with redshift or X-rayluminosity. The lack of a correlation with L$_{X}$, places strong constraintson the importance of ram-pressure stripping as a driver of the Butcher-Oemlereffect.

Detection of an Extrasolar Planet Atmosphere

  We report high precision spectrophotometric observations of four planetarytransits of HD 209458, in the region of the sodium resonance doublet at 589.3nm. We find that the photometric dimming during transit in a bandpass centeredon the sodium feature is deeper by (2.32 +/- 0.57) x 10^{-4} relative tosimultaneous observations of the transit in adjacent bands. We interpret thisadditional dimming as absorption from sodium in the planetary atmosphere, asrecently predicted from several theoretical modeling efforts. Our model for acloudless planetary atmosphere with a solar abundance of sodium in atomic formpredicts more sodium absorption than we observe. There are severalpossibilities that may account for this reduced amplitude, including reactionof atomic sodium into molecular gases and/or condensates, photoionization ofsodium by the stellar flux, a low primordial abundance of sodium, or thepresence of clouds high in the atmosphere.

The Holographic Life of the eta'

  In the string holographic dual of large-N_c QCD with N_f flavours ofKruczenski et al, the eta' meson is massless at infinite N_c and dual to acollective fluctuation of N_f D6-brane probes in a supergravity background.Here we identify the string diagrams responsible for the generation of a massof order N_f/N_c, consistent with the Witten-Veneziano formula, and show thatthe supregravity limit of these diagrams corresponds to mixings withpseudoscalar glueballs. We argue that the dependence on the theta-angle in thesupergravity description occurs only through the combination theta + 2\sqrt{N_f} eta' / f_pi, as dictated by the U(1) anomaly. We provide aquantitative test by computing the linear term in the eta' potential in twoindependent ways, with perfect agreement.

Laser ablation loading of a surface-electrode ion trap

  We demonstrate loading by laser ablation of $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions into amm-scale surface-electrode ion trap. The laser used for ablation is a pulsed,frequency-tripled Nd:YAG with pulse energies of 1-10 mJ and durations of 3-5ns. An additional laser is not required to photoionize the ablated material.The efficiency and lifetime of several candidate materials for the laserablation target are characterized by measuring the trapped ion fluorescencesignal for a number of consecutive loads. Additionally, laser ablation is usedto load traps with a trap depth (40 meV) below where electron impact ionizationloading is typically successful ($\gtrsim$ 500 meV).

Rational extensions of the quantum harmonic oscillator and exceptional  Hermite polynomials

  We prove that every rational extension of the quantum harmonic oscillatorthat is exactly solvable by polynomials is monodromy free, and therefore can beobtained by applying a finite number of state-deleting Darboux transformationson the harmonic oscillator. Equivalently, every exceptional orthogonalpolynomial system of Hermite type can be obtained by applying a Darboux-Crumtransformation to the classical Hermite polynomials. Exceptional Hermitepolynomial systems only exist for even codimension 2m, and they are indexed bythe partitions \lambda of m. We provide explicit expressions for theircorresponding orthogonality weights and differential operators and a separateproof of their completeness. Exceptional Hermite polynomials satisfy a 2l+3recurrence relation where l is the length of the partition \lambda. Explicitexpressions for such recurrence relations are given.

Asymptotically perfect efficient quantum state transfer across uniform  chains with two impurities

  The ability to transfer quantum information from one location to another withhigh fidelity is of central importance to quantum information science.Unfortunately for the simplest system of a uniform chain (a spin chain or aparticle in a one-dimensional lattice), the state transfer time growsexponentially in the chain length $N$ at fixed fidelity. In this work we showthat the addition of an impurity near each endpoint, coupled to the uniformchain with strength $w$, is sufficient to ensure efficient and high-fidelitystate transfer. An eigenstate localized in the vicinity of the impurity can betuned into resonance with chain extended states by tuning $w(N)\proptoN^{1/2}$; the resulting avoided crossing yields resonant eigenstates with largeamplitudes on the chain endpoints and approximately equidistant eigenvalues.The state transfer time scales as $t\propto N^{3/2}$ and its fidelity $F$approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$; the error scales as$1-F\propto N^{-1}$. Thus, with the addition of two impurities, asymptoticallyperfect state transfer with a uniform chain is possible even in the absence ofexternal control.

Direct single-shot observation of millimeter wave superradiance in  Rydberg-Rydberg transitions

  We have directly detected millimeter wave (mm-wave) free space superradiantemission from Rydberg states ($n \sim 30$) of barium atoms in a single shot. Wetrigger the cooperative effects with a weak initial pulse and detect withsingle-shot sensitivity and 20 ps time resolution, which allows measurement andshot-by-shot analysis of the distribution of decay rates, time delays, andtime-dependent frequency shifts. Cooperative line shifts and decay rates areobserved that exceed values that would correspond to the Doppler width of 250kHz by a factor of 20 and the spontaneous emission rate of 50 Hz by a factor of$10^5$. The initial superradiant output pulse is followed by evolution of theradiation-coupled many-body system toward complex long-lasting emission modes.A comparison to a mean-field theory is presented which reproduces thequantitative time-domain results, but fails to account for either thefrequency-domain observations or the long-lived features.

Two dimensional ordering and collective magnetic excitations in the  dilute ferromagnetic topological insulator  (Bi$_{0.95}$Mn$_{0.05}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$

  Employing elastic and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) techniques, wereport on detailed microscopic properties of the ferromagnetism in he magnetictopological insulator (Bi$_{0.95}$Mn$_{0.05}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. Neutrondiffraction of polycrystalline samples show the ferromagnetic (FM) ordering islong-range within the basal plane, and mainly 2D in character with short-rangecorrelations between layers below $T_{\mathrm{C}} \approx 13$ K. Despite therandom distribution of the dliute Mn atoms, we find that the 2D-like magneticpeaks are commensurate with the chemical structure, and the absence of (00L)magnetic peaks denote that the Mn$^{2+}$ magnetic moments are normal to thebasal planes. Surprisingly, we observed collective magnetic excitations, inthis dilute magnetic system. Despite the dilute nature, the excitations aretypical of quasi-2D FM systems, albeit are severely broadened at shortwavelengths, likely due to the random spatial distribution of Mn atoms in theBi planes. Detailed analysis of the INS provide energy scales of the exchangecouplings and the single ion anisotropy.

Hydra II: a faint and compact Milky Way dwarf galaxy found in the Survey  of the Magellanic Stellar History

  We present the discovery of a new dwarf galaxy, Hydra II, foundserendipitously within the data from the ongoing Survey of the MAgellanicStellar History (SMASH) conducted with the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco 4mTelescope. The new satellite is compact (r_h = 68 +/- 11 pc) and faint (M_V =-4.8 +/- 0.3), but well within the realm of dwarf galaxies. The stellardistribution of HydraII in the color-magnitude diagram is well-described by ametal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.2) and old (13 Gyr) isochrone and shows a distinct bluehorizontal branch, some possible red clump stars, and faint stars that aresuggestive of blue stragglers. At a heliocentric distance of 134 +/- 10 kpc,Hydra II is located in a region of the Galactic halo that models have suggestedmay host material from the leading arm of the Magellanic Stream. A comparisonwith N-body simulations hints that the new dwarf galaxy could be or could havebeen a satellite of the Magellanic Clouds.

Power generation from a radiative thermal source using a large-area  infrared rectenna

  Electrical power generation from a moderate temperature thermal source bymeans of direct conversion of infrared radiation is important and highlydesirable for energy harvesting from waste heat and micropower applications.Here, we demonstrate direct rectified power generation from an unbiasedlarge-area nanoantenna-coupled tunnel diode rectifier, called a rectenna. Usinga vacuum radiometric measurement technique with irradiation from atemperature-stabilized thermal source, a generated power density of 8 nW/cm$^2$is observed at a source temperature of 450C for the unbiased rectenna across anoptimized load resistance. The optimized load resistance for the peak powergeneration for each temperature coincides with the tunnel diode resistance atzero bias and corresponds to the impedance matching condition for a rectifyingantenna. Current voltage measurements of a thermally illuminated large-arearectenna show current zero crossing shifts into the second quadrant indicatingrectification. Photon-assisted tunneling in the unbiased rectenna is modeled asthe mechanism for the large short-circuit photocurrents observed where thephoton energy serves as an effective bias across the tunnel junction. Themeasured current and voltage across the load resistor as a function of thethermal source temperature represents direct current electrical powergeneration.

Spectral Typing of Late Type Stellar Companions to Young Stars from Low  Dispersion Near-Infrared Integral Field Unit Data

  We used the Project 1640 near-infrared coronagraph and integral fieldspectrograph to observe 19 young solar type stars. Five of these stars areknown binary stars and we detected the late-type secondaries and were able tomeasure their JH spectra with a resolution of R\sim30. The reduced, extracted,and calibrated spectra were compared to template spectra from the IRTF spectrallibrary. With this comparison we test the accuracy and consistency of spectraltype determination with the low-resolution near-infrared spectra from P1640.Additionally, we determine effective temperature and surface gravity of thecompanions by fitting synthetic spectra calculated with the PHOENIX modelatmosphere code. We also present several new epochs of astrometry of each ofthe systems. Together these data increase our knowledge and understanding ofthe stellar make up of these systems. In addition to the astronomical results,the analysis presented helps validate the Project 1640 data reduction andspectral extraction processes and the utility of low-resolution, near-infraredspectra for characterizing late-type companions in multiple systems.

Low Frequency Imaging of Fields at High Galactic Latitude with the  Murchison Widefield Array 32-Element Prototype

  The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a new low-frequency, widefield-of-view radio interferometer under development at the MurchisonRadio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia. We have used a32-element MWA prototype interferometer (MWA-32T) to observe two 50-degreediameter fields in the southern sky in the 110 MHz to 200 MHz band in order toevaluate the performance of the MWA-32T, to develop techniques for epoch ofreionization experiments, and to make measurements of astronomical foregrounds.We developed a calibration and imaging pipeline for the MWA-32T, and used it toproduce ~15' angular resolution maps of the two fields. We perform a blindsource extraction using these confusion-limited images, and detect 655 sourcesat high significance with an additional 871 lower significance sourcecandidates. We compare these sources with existing low-frequency radio surveysin order to assess the MWA-32T system performance, wide field analysisalgorithms, and catalog quality. Our source catalog is found to agree well withexisting low-frequency surveys in these regions of the sky and with statisticaldistributions of point sources derived from Northern Hemisphere surveys; itrepresents one of the deepest surveys to date of this sky field in the 110 MHzto 200 MHz band.

HAT-P-31b,c: A Transiting, Eccentric, Hot Jupiter and a Long-Period,  Massive Third-Body

  We report the discovery of HAT-P-31b, a transiting exoplanet orbiting theV=11.660 dwarf star GSC 2099-00908. HAT-P-31b is the first HAT planetdiscovered without any follow-up photometry, demonstrating the feasibility of anew mode of operation for the HATNet project. The 2.17 Mj, 1.1Rj planet has aperiod P = 5.0054 days and maintains an unusually high eccentricity of e =0.2450+/-0.0045, determined through Keck, FIES and Subaru high precision radialvelocities. Detailed modeling of the radial velocities indicates an additionalquadratic residual trend in the data detected to very high confidence. Weinterpret this trend as a long-period outer companion, HAT-P-31c, of minimummass 3.4Mj and period >2.8 years. Since current RVs span less than half anorbital period, we are unable to determine the properties of HAT-P-31c to highconfidence. However, dynamical simulations of two possible configurations showthat orbital stability is to be expected. Further, if HAT-P-31c has non-zeroeccentricity, our simulations show that the eccentricity of HAT-P-31b isactively driven by the presence of c, making HAT-P-31 a potentially intriguingdynamical laboratory.

KELT-11b: A Highly Inflated Sub-Saturn Exoplanet Transiting the V=8  Subgiant HD 93396

  We report the discovery of a transiting exoplanet, KELT-11b, orbiting thebright ($V=8.0$) subgiant HD 93396. A global analysis of the system shows thatthe host star is an evolved subgiant star with $T_{\rm eff} = 5370\pm51$ K,$M_{*} = 1.438_{-0.052}^{+0.061} M_{\odot}$, $R_{*} = 2.72_{-0.17}^{+0.21}R_{\odot}$, log $g_*= 3.727_{-0.046}^{+0.040}$, and [Fe/H]$ = 0.180\pm0.075$.The planet is a low-mass gas giant in a $P = 4.736529\pm0.00006$ day orbit,with $M_{P} = 0.195\pm0.018 M_J$, $R_{P}= 1.37_{-0.12}^{+0.15} R_J$, $\rho_{P}= 0.093_{-0.024}^{+0.028}$ g cm$^{-3}$, surface gravity log ${g_{P}} =2.407_{-0.086}^{+0.080}$, and equilibrium temperature $T_{eq} =1712_{-46}^{+51}$ K. KELT-11 is the brightest known transiting exoplanet hostin the southern hemisphere by more than a magnitude, and is the 6th brightesttransit host to date. The planet is one of the most inflated planets known,with an exceptionally large atmospheric scale height (2763 km), and anassociated size of the expected atmospheric transmission signal of 5.6%. Theseattributes make the KELT-11 system a valuable target for follow-up andatmospheric characterization, and it promises to become one of the benchmarksystems for the study of inflated exoplanets.

A Radio Counterpart for the Unidentified TeV Source HESS J1813-178: The  Radio-Gamma-Ray Connection

  We discovered independently the shell-type supernova remnant G12.82-0.02,recently reported by Brogan et al. (2005), which is coincident with theunidentified TeV gamma-ray source revealed in the HESS survey of the Galacticplane. Estimating the ambient starlight at the location of this source from theintegrated Ly alpha luminosity of the nearby H II region W33, we conclude thatinverse Compton emission is a viable explanation for the observed TeV emission.Examining remnants in the survey of Aharonian et al. (2005a) including thosedetected above 200 Gev and those not detected, we find a strikingly large rangeof more than three orders of magnitude in the radio to TeV flux ratios. Webriefly explore the possible explanations of this range and the implicationsfor the TeV emission mechanism.

The FourStar Infrared Camera

  The FourStar infrared camera is a 1.0-2.5 micron (JHKs) near infrared camerafor the Magellan Baade 6.5m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory (Chile). Itis being built by Carnegie Observatories and the Instrument Development Groupat Johns Hopkins and is scheduled for completion in 2009. The instrument usesfour Teledyne HAWAII-2RG arrays that produce a 10.9 x 10.9 arcmin field ofview. The outstanding seeing at the Las Campanas site coupled with FourStar'shigh sensitivity and large field of view will enable many new survey andtargeted science programs.

Magnetic and lattice coupling in single-crystal SrFe$_2$As$_2$: A  neutron scattering study

  A detailed elastic neutron scattering study of the structural and magneticphase transitions in single-crystal SrFe$_2$As$_2$ reveals that theorthorhombic (O)-tetragonal (T) and the antiferromagnetic transitions coincideat $T_\texttt{O}$ = $T_\texttt{N}$ = (201.5 $\pm$ 0.25) K. The observation ofcoexisting O-T phases over a finite temperature range at the transition and thesudden onset of the O distortion provide strong evidences that the structuraltransition is first order. The simultaneous appearance and disappearance within0.5 K upon cooling and within 0.25 K upon warming, respectively, indicate thatthe magnetic and structural transitions are intimately coupled. We find thatthe hysteresis in the transition temperature extends over a 1-2 K range. Basedon the observation of a remnant orthorhombic phase at temperatures higher than\emph{T}$_\texttt{O}$, we suggest that the T-O transition may be anorder-disorder transition.

Deep borehole disposal of nuclear waste: US perspective

  Radioactive waste disposal in deep boreholes may be more "ready" thandisposal in mined geologic repositories since mankind has greater experienceoperating small deep holes - boreholes, than big shallow holes - mines. Thereare several thousand precedents for constructing >2 km deep boreholes andseveral hundred precedents for disposing long-lived wastes in boreholes.Borehole disposal is likely to be faster, cheaper, and more flexible than mineddisposal, while also offering greater long-term isolation. Isolation would relyon the great depth, water density gradients, and reducing conditions to preventvertical movement of waste up the borehole.

Observation of squeezed light in the 2 $\mathrm{μm}$ region

  We present the generation and detection of squeezed light in the 2$\mathrm{\mu m}$ wavelength region. This experiment is a crucial step inrealising the quantum noise reduction techniques that will be required forfuture generations of gravitational-wave detectors. Squeezed vacuum isgenerated via degenerate optical parametric oscillation from aperiodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal, in a dual resonantcavity. The experiment uses a frequency stabilised 1984 nm thulium fibre laser,and squeezing is detected using balanced homodyne detection with extendedInGaAs photodiodes. We have measured $4.0 \pm 0.1$ dB of squeezing and $10.5\pm 0.5$ dB of anti-squeezing relative to the shot noise level in the audiofrequency band, limited by photodiode quantum efficiency. The inferredsqueezing level directly after the optical parametric oscillator, afteraccounting for known losses and phase noise, is 10.7 dB.
