Fluctuation-dissipation ratios in the dynamics of self-assembly

  We consider two seemingly very different self-assembly processes: formation
of viral capsids, and crystallization of sticky discs. At low temperatures,
assembly is ineffective, since there are many metastable disordered states,
which are a source of kinetic frustration. We use fluctuation-dissipation
ratios to extract information about the degree of this frustration. We show
that our analysis is a useful indicator of the long term fate of the system,
based on the early stages of assembly.


A Comprehensive Search for Low-Energy Lines in BATSE GRBs

  A computer-based technique has been developed to search bright BATSE
gamma-ray bursts for spectral lines in a comprehensive manner. The first
results of the search are discussed and an example line candidate shown.


Complex optimal transport and the pluripotential theory of
  Kähler-Ricci solitons

  Let (X,L) be a (semi-) polarized complex projective variety and T a real
torus acting holomorphically on X with moment polytope P. Given a probability
density g on P we introduce a new type of Monge-Ampere measure on X, defined
for singular T-invariant metrics on the line bundle L, generalizing the
ordinary Monge-Ampere of global pluripotential theory, which corresponds to the
case when T is trivial (or g=1). In the opposite extreme case when T has
maximal rank, i.e. (X,L,T) is a toric variety, the solution of the
corresponding Monge-Ampere equation with right hand side \mu corresponds to the
convex Kantorovich potential for the optimal transport map in the
Monge-Kantorovich transport problem betweeen \mu and g (for a quadratic cost
function). Accordingly, our general setting can be seen as a complex version of
optimal transport theory. Our main complex geometric applications concern the
pluripotential study of singular (shrinking) Kahler-Ricci solitons. In
particular, we establish the uniqueness of such solitons, modulo automorphisms,
and explore their relation to a notion of modified K-stability inspired by the
work of Tian-Zhu. The quantization of this setup, in the sense of Donaldson, is
also studied.


A vanishing theorem for weight one syzygies

  Inspired by the methods of Voisin, the first two authors recently proved that
one could read off the gonality of a curve C from the syzygies of its ideal in
any one embedding of sufficiently large degree. This was deduced from from a
vanishing theorem for the asymptotic syzygies associated to an arbitrary line
bundle B on C. The present paper extends this vanishing theorem to a smooth
projective variety X of arbitrary dimension. Specifically, given a line bundle
B on X, we prove that if B is p-jet very ample (i.e. the sections of B separate
jets of total weight p+1) then the weight one Koszul cohomology group
K_{p,1}(X, B; L) vanishes for all sufficiently positive L. In the other
direction, we show that if there is a reduced cycle of length p+1 that fails to
impose independent conditions on sections of B, then the Koszul group in
question is non-zero for very positive L.


Negative differential mobility of weakly driven particles in models of
  glass formers

  We study the response of probe particles to weak constant driving in
kinetically constrained models of glassy systems, and show that the probe's
response can be non-monotonic and give rise to negative differential mobility:
increasing the applied force can reduce the probe's drift velocity in the force
direction. Oth er significant non-linear effects are also demonstrated, such as
the enhancement with increasing force of the probe's fluctuations away from the
average path, a phenomenon known in other contexts as giant diffusivity. We
show that these res ults can be explained analytically by a continuous-time
random walk approximatio n where there is decoupling between persistence and
exchange times for local dis placements of the probe. This decoupling is due to
dynamic heterogeneity in the glassy system, which also leads to bimodal
distributions of probe particle disp lacements. We discuss the relevance of our
results to experiments.


Convergence of Bergman measures for high powers of a line bundle

  Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on a compact complex manifold $X$ of
dimension $n,$ and let $e^{-\phi}$ be a continuous metric on $L.$ Fixing a
measure $d\mu$ on $X$ gives a sequence of Hilbert spaces consisting of
holomorphic sections of tensor powers of $L.$ We prove that the corresponding
sequence of scaled Bergman measures converges, in the high tensor power limit,
to the equilibrium measure of the pair $(K,\phi),$ where $K$ is the support of
$d\mu,$ as long as $d\mu$ is stably Bernstein-Markov with respect to
$(K,\phi).$ Here the Bergman measure denotes $d\mu$ times the restriction to
the diagonal of the pointwise norm of the corresponding orthogonal projection
operator. In particular, an extension to higher dimensions is obtained of
results concerning random matrices and classical orthogonal polynomials.


Global dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensation for a model of the
  Kompaneets equation

  The Kompaneets equation describes a field of photons exchanging energy by
Compton scattering with the free electrons of a homogeneous, isotropic,
non-relativistic, thermal plasma. This paper strives to advance our
understanding of how this equation captures the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein
condensation through the study of a model equation. For this model we prove
existence and uniqueness theorems for global weak solutions. In some cases a
Bose-Einstein condensate will form in finite time, and we show that it will
continue to gain photons forever afterwards. Moreover we show that every
solution approaches a stationary solution for large time. Key tools include a
universal super solution, a one-sided Oleinik type inequality, and an $L^1$
contraction.


New Clock Comparison Searches for Lorentz and CPT Violation

  We present two new measurements constraining Lorentz and CPT violation using
the Xe-129 / He-3 Zeeman maser and atomic hydrogen masers. Experimental
investigations of Lorentz and CPT symmetry provide important tests of the
framework of the standard model of particle physics and theories of gravity.
The two-species Xe-129 / He-3 Zeeman maser bounds violations of CPT and Lorentz
symmetry of the neutron at the 10^-31 GeV level. Measurements with atomic
hydrogen masers provide a clean limit of CPT and Lorentz symmetry violation of
the proton at the 10^-27 GeV level.


Suppression of Reabsorption via Modulation of Light

  Reabsorption, the multiple scattering of spontaneously emitted photons in
optically thick gases, is a major limitation to efficient optical pumping and
laser cooling in ultracold gases. We report mitigation of reabsorption using
spatial and frequency modulation of laser light illuminating such gases. We
developed a semi-classical model that successfully describes the reabsorption
process when frequency-modulated light is present. It was necessary to extend
the treatment in the model beyond a simple two-atom picture in order to
reproduce our experimental results.


Hyperentangled States

  We investigate a new class of entangled states, which we call
'hyperentangled',that have EPR correlations identical to those in the vacuum
state of a relativistic quantum field. We show that whenever hyperentangled
states exist in any quantum theory, they are dense in its state space. We also
give prescriptions for constructing hyperentangled states that involve an
arbitrarily large collection of systems.


PDE approximation of large systems of differential equations

  A large system of ordinary differential equations is approximated by a
parabolic partial differential equation with dynamic boundary condition and a
different one with Robin boundary condition. Using the theory of differential
operators with Wentzell boundary conditions and similar theories, we give
estimates on the order of approximation. The theory is demonstrated on a voter
model where the Fourier method applied to the PDE is of great advantage.


Monte Carlo Studies of the Orientational Order-Disorder Phase Transition
  in Solid Ammonium Chloride

  Monte Carlo methods are used to study the phase transition in ammonium
chloride from the orientationally ordered $\delta$ phase to the orientationally
disordered $\gamma$ phase. An effective pair potential is used to model the
interaction between ions. Thermodynamic properties are computed in the
canonical and isothermal-isobaric ensembles. Each ammonium ion is treated as a
rigidly rotating body and the lattice is fixed in the low-temperature CsCl
geometry. A simple extension of the Metropolis Monte Carlo method is used to
overcome quasiergodicity in the rotational sampling. In the constant-$NVT$
calculations the lattice is held rigid; in the constant-$NpT$ calculations the
lattice parameter is allowed to fluctuate. In both ensembles the order
parameter rapidly falls to zero in the range (200 - 250)K, suggesting that the
model disorders at a temperature in fair agreement with the experimental
disordering temperature (243K). Peaks in the heat capacity and thermal
expansivity curves are also found in the same temperature range.


Computational Study of the Structure and Thermodynamic Properties of
  Ammonium Chloride Clusters Using a Parallel J-Walking Approach

  The thermodynamic and structural properties of (NH$_4$Cl)$_n$ clusters,
n=3-10 are studied. Using the method of simulated annealing, the geometries of
several isomers for each cluster size are examined. Jump-walking Monte Carlo
simulations are then used to compute the constant-volume heat capacity for each
cluster size over a wide temperature range. To carry out these simulations a
new parallel algorithm is developed using the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM)
software package. Features of the cluster potential energy surfaces, such as
energy differences among isomers and rotational barriers of the ammonium ions,
are found to play important roles in determining the shape of the heat capacity
curves.


Magnetic and lattice coupling in single-crystal SrFe$_2$As$_2$: A
  neutron scattering study

  A detailed elastic neutron scattering study of the structural and magnetic
phase transitions in single-crystal SrFe$_2$As$_2$ reveals that the
orthorhombic (O)-tetragonal (T) and the antiferromagnetic transitions coincide
at $T_\texttt{O}$ = $T_\texttt{N}$ = (201.5 $\pm$ 0.25) K. The observation of
coexisting O-T phases over a finite temperature range at the transition and the
sudden onset of the O distortion provide strong evidences that the structural
transition is first order. The simultaneous appearance and disappearance within
0.5 K upon cooling and within 0.25 K upon warming, respectively, indicate that
the magnetic and structural transitions are intimately coupled. We find that
the hysteresis in the transition temperature extends over a 1-2 K range. Based
on the observation of a remnant orthorhombic phase at temperatures higher than
\emph{T}$_\texttt{O}$, we suggest that the T-O transition may be an
order-disorder transition.


Broadband reduction of quantum radiation pressure noise via squeezed
  light injection

  We present the reduction and manipulation of quantum radiation pressure noise
(QRPN) in an optomechanical cavity with the injection of squeezed light. The
optomechanical system consists of a high-reflectivity single-crystal
microresonator which serves as one mirror of a Fabry-Perot cavity. The
experiment is performed at room temperature and is QRPN dominated between 10
kHz and 50 kHz, frequencies relevant to gravitational wave observatories. We
observed a reduction of 1.2 dB in the measurement noise floor with the
injection of amplitude squeezed light generated from a below-threshold
degenerate optical parametric oscillator. This experiment is a crucial step in
realizing the reduction of QRPN for future interferometric gravitational wave
detectors and improving their sensitivity.


A Brown Dwarf Census from the SIMP Survey

  We have conducted a near-infrared (NIR) proper motion survey, the Sondage
Infrarouge de Mouvement Propre, in order to discover field ultracool dwarfs
(UCD) in the solar neighborhood. The survey was conducted by imaging $\sim28\%$
of the sky with the Cam\'era PAnoramique Proche-InfraRouge both in the southern
hemisphere at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 1.5 m telescope, and
in the northern hemisphere at the Observatoire du Mont-M\'egantic 1.6 m
telescope and comparing the source positions from these observations with the
Two Micron All-Sky Survey Point Source Catalog (2MASS PSC). Additional color
criteria were used to further discriminate unwanted astrophysical sources. We
present the results of an NIR spectroscopic follow-up of 169 M, L, and T
dwarfs. Among the sources discovered are 2 young field brown dwarfs, 6
unusually red M and L dwarfs, 25 unusually blue M and L dwarfs, 2 candidate
unresolved L+T binaries, and 24 peculiar UCDs. Additionally, we add 9 L/T
transition dwarfs (L6--T4.5) to the already known objects.


Glassy behaviour in an exactly solved spin system with a ferromagnetic
  transition

  We show that applying simple dynamical rules to Baxter's eight-vertex model
leads to a system which resembles a glass-forming liquid. There are analogies
with liquid, supercooled liquid, glassy and crystalline states. The disordered
phases exhibit strong dynamical heterogeneity at low temperatures, which may be
described in terms of an emergent mobility field. Their dynamics are
well-described by a simple model with trivial thermodynamics, but an emergent
kinetic constraint. We show that the (second order) thermodynamic transition to
the ordered phase may be interpreted in terms of confinement of the excitations
in the mobility field. We also describe the aging of disordered states towards
the ordered phase, in terms of simple rate equations.


Space-time thermodynamics and subsystem observables in a kinetically
  constrained model of glassy systems

  In a recent article [M. Merolle et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102, 10837
(2005)] it was argued that dynamic heterogeneity in $d$-dimensional glass
formers is a manifestation of an order-disorder phenomenon in the $d+1$
dimensions of spacetime. By considering a dynamical analogue of the free
energy, evidence was found for phase coexistence between active and inactive
regions of spacetime, and it was suggested that this phenomenon underlies the
glass transition. Here we develop these ideas further by investigating in
detail the one-dimensional Fredrickson-Andersen (FA) model in which the active
and inactive phases originate in the reducibility of the dynamics. We
illustrate the phase coexistence by considering the distributions of mesoscopic
spacetime observables. We show how the analogy with phase coexistence can be
strengthened by breaking microscopic reversibility in the FA model, leading to
a non-equilibrium theory in the directed percolation universality class.


Electron impact ionization loading of a surface electrode ion trap

  We demonstrate a method for loading surface electrode ion traps by electron
impact ionization. The method relies on the property of surface electrode
geometries that the trap depth can be increased at the cost of more
micromotion. By introducing a buffer gas, we can counteract the rf heating
assocated with the micromotion and benefit from the larger trap depth. After an
initial loading of the trap, standard compensation techniques can be used to
cancel the stray fields resulting from charged dielectric and allow for the
loading of the trap at ultra-high vacuum.


MalStone: Towards A Benchmark for Analytics on Large Data Clouds

  Developing data mining algorithms that are suitable for cloud computing
platforms is currently an active area of research, as is developing cloud
computing platforms appropriate for data mining. Currently, the most common
benchmark for cloud computing is the Terasort (and related) benchmarks.
Although the Terasort Benchmark is quite useful, it was not designed for data
mining per se. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark called MalStone that is
specifically designed to measure the performance of cloud computing middleware
that supports the type of data intensive computing common when building data
mining models. We also introduce MalGen, which is a utility for generating data
on clouds that can be used with MalStone.


Extended Depth of Field for High Resolution Scanning Transmission
  Electron Microscopy

  Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM)
provide sub-angstrom lateral resolution; however, the large convergence angle
greatly reduces the depth of field. For microscopes with a small depth of
field, information outside of the focal plane quickly becomes blurred and less
defined. It may not be possible to image some samples entirely in focus.
Extended depth-of-field techniques, however, allow a single image, with all
areas in-focus, to be extracted from a series of images focused at a range of
depths. In recent years, a variety of algorithmic approaches have been employed
for bright field optical microscopy. Here, we demonstrate that some established
optical microscopy methods can also be applied to extend the ~6 nm depth of
focus of a 100 kV 5th-order aberration-corrected STEM (alpha_max = 33 mrad) to
image Pt-Co nanoparticles on a thick vulcanized carbon support. These
techniques allow us to automatically obtain a single image with all the
particles in focus as well as a complimentary topography map.


Finite-temperature critical point of a glass transition

  We generalize the simplest kinetically constrained model of a glass-forming
liquid by softening kinetic constraints, allowing them to be violated with a
small finite rate. We demonstrate that this model supports a first-order
dynamical (space-time) phase transition, similar to those observed with hard
constraints. In addition, we find that the first-order phase boundary in this
softened model ends in a finite-temperature dynamical critical point, which we
expect to be present in natural systems. We discuss links between this critical
point and quantum phase transitions, showing that dynamical phase transitions
in $d$ dimensions map to quantum transitions in the same dimension, and hence
to classical thermodynamic phase transitions in $d+1$ dimensions. We make these
links explicit through exact mappings between master operators, transfer
matrices, and Hamiltonians for quantum spin chains.


Preparation and relaxation of very stable glassy states of a simulated
  liquid

  We prepare metastable glassy states in a model glass-former made of
Lennard-Jones particles by sampling biased ensembles of trajectories with low
dynamical activity. These trajectories form an inactive dynamical phase whose
`fast' vibrational degrees of freedom are maintained at thermal equilibrium by
contact with a heat bath, while the `slow' structural degrees of freedom are
located in deep valleys of the energy landscape. We examine the relaxation to
equilibrium and the vibrational properties of these metastable states. The
glassy states we prepare by our trajectory sampling method are very stable to
thermal fluctuations and also more mechanically rigid than low-temperature
equilibrated configurations.


Data Processing For Atomic Resolution EELS

  The high beam current and sub-angstrom resolution of aberration-corrected
scanning transmission electron microscopes has enabled electron energy loss
spectroscopic (EELS) mapping with atomic resolution. These spectral maps are
often dose-limited and spatially oversampled, leading to low counts/channel and
are thus highly sensitive to errors in background estimation. However, by
taking advantage of redundancy in the dataset map one can improve background
estimation and increase chemical sensitivity. We consider two such approaches-
linear combination of power laws and local background averaging-that reduce
background error and improve signal extraction. Principal components analysis
(PCA) can also be used to analyze spectrum images, but the poor
peak-to-background ratio in EELS can lead to serious artifacts if raw EELS data
is PCA filtered. We identify common artifacts and discuss alternative
approaches. These algorithms are implemented within the Cornell Spectrum
Imager, an open source software package for spectroscopic analysis.


Non-contact hemodynamic imaging reveals the jugular venous pulse
  waveform

  Cardiovascular monitoring is important to prevent diseases from progressing.
The jugular venous pulse (JVP) waveform offers important clinical information
about cardiac health, but is not routinely examined due to its invasive
catheterisation procedure. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the JVP
can be consistently observed in a non-contact manner using a novel light-based
photoplethysmographic imaging system, coded hemodynamic imaging (CHI). While
traditional monitoring methods measure the JVP at a single location, CHI's
wide-field imaging capabilities were able to observe the jugular venous pulse's
spatial flow profile for the first time. The important inflection points in the
JVP were observed, meaning that cardiac abnormalities can be assessed through
JVP distortions. CHI provides a new way to assess cardiac health through
non-contact light-based JVP monitoring, and can be used in non-surgical
environments for cardiac assessment.


Interactive Learning from Policy-Dependent Human Feedback

  For agents and robots to become more useful, they must be able to quickly
learn from non-technical users. This paper investigates the problem of
interactively learning behaviors communicated by a human teacher using positive
and negative feedback. Much previous work on this problem has made the
assumption that people provide feedback for decisions that is dependent on the
behavior they are teaching and is independent from the learner's current
policy. We present empirical results that show this assumption to be
false---whether human trainers give a positive or negative feedback for a
decision is influenced by the learner's current policy. We argue that
policy-dependent feedback, in addition to being commonplace, enables useful
training strategies from which agents should benefit. Based on this insight, we
introduce Convergent Actor-Critic by Humans (COACH), an algorithm for learning
from policy-dependent feedback that converges to a local optimum. Finally, we
demonstrate that COACH can successfully learn multiple behaviors on a physical
robot, even with noisy image features.


QCD and Hadron Physics

  This document presents the recommendations and scientific conclusions from
the Town Meeting on QCD and Hadronic Physics that took place in the period
13-15 September 2014 at Temple University as part of the NSAC 2014 Long Range
Planning process. It highlights progress in hadron physics in the seven years
since the 2007 Long Range Plan (LRP07), and presents a vision for the future by
identifying key questions and plausible paths to solutions which should define
our next decade. In defining the priority of outstanding physics opportunities
for the future, both prospects for the short (roughly 5 years) and longer term
(beyond 10 years) are identified together with the facilities, personnel and
other resources needed to maximize the discovery potential in hadronic physics
worldwide. In this connection, the potential of an electron ion collider is
highlighted.


A Close Companion Search around L Dwarfs using Aperture Masking
  Interferometry and Palomar Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics

  We present a close companion search around sixteen known early-L dwarfs using
aperture masking interferometry with Palomar laser guide star adaptive optics.
The use of aperture masking allows the detection of close binaries,
corresponding to projected physical separations of 0.6-10.0 AU for the targets
of our survey. This survey achieved median contrast limits of Delta_K ~ 2.3 for
separations between 1.2 - 4 lambda/D, and Delta_K ~ 1.4 at (2/3)lambda/D.
  We present four candidate binaries detected with moderate to high confidence
(90-98%). Two have projected physical separations less than 1.5 AU. This may
indicate that tight-separation binaries contribute more significantly to the
binary fraction than currently assumed, consistent with spectroscopic and
photometric overluminosity studies.
  Ten targets of this survey have previously been observed with the Hubble
Space Telescope as part of companion searches. We use the increased resolution
of aperture masking to search for close or dim companions that would be
obscured by full aperture imaging, finding two candidate binaries.
  This survey is the first application of aperture masking with laser guide
star adaptive optics at Palomar. Several new techniques for the analysis of
aperture masking data in the low signal to noise regime are explored.


The First FIRST Gravitationally Lensed Quasar: FBQ 0951+2635

  The V=16.9 quasar FBQ 0951+2635 at redshift z=1.24 appears double on CCD
exposures taken in subarcsecond seeing. The two objects are separated by 1.1"
and differ in brightness by 0.9 mag. VLA observations show the radio source to
be double with the same separation and position angle. Spectra taken with the
Keck II telescope show the two components to have nearly identical emission
line spectra, but with somewhat different absorption line systems. Subtraction
of two stellar point spread functions from the pair of components consistently
leaves a residual object. Depending upon whether this third object is extended
or a point source it may be as much as 1/10 or as little as 1/100 as bright as
the brighter QSO component. The observations leave no doubt that the 2 brighter
objects are gravitationally lensed images of the same quasar. The third object
might be either the lensing galaxy or a third image of the quasar, but both
interpretations have serious shortcomings.


On the Near-Infrared Size of Vega

  Near-infrared (2.2 um) long baseline interferometric observations of Vega are
presented. The stellar disk of the star has been resolved, and the data have
been fitted with a limb darkened stellar disk of diameter Theta_{LD} = 3.28 +/-
0.01 mas. The derived effective temperature is T_eff = 9553 +/- 111 K. However,
the residuals resulting from the stellar disk model appear to be significant
and display organized structure. Instrumental artifacts, stellar surface
structure, stellar atmosphere structure, and extended emission/scattering from
the debris disk are discussed as possible sources of the residuals. While the
current dataset cannot uniquely determine the origin of the residuals, the
debris disk is found to be the most likely source. A simple debris disk model,
with 3-6% of Vega's flux emanating from the disk at r < 4 AU, can explain the
residuals.


The Butcher-Oemler Effect in High Redshift X-ray Selected Clusters

  We are engaged in a wide-field, multi-colour imaging survey of X-ray selected
clusters at intermediate and high redshift. We present blue fractions for the
first 8 out of 29 clusters, covering almost a factor of 100 in X-ray
luminosity. We find no correlation of blue fraction with redshift or X-ray
luminosity. The lack of a correlation with L$_{X}$, places strong constraints
on the importance of ram-pressure stripping as a driver of the Butcher-Oemler
effect.


Detection of an Extrasolar Planet Atmosphere

  We report high precision spectrophotometric observations of four planetary
transits of HD 209458, in the region of the sodium resonance doublet at 589.3
nm. We find that the photometric dimming during transit in a bandpass centered
on the sodium feature is deeper by (2.32 +/- 0.57) x 10^{-4} relative to
simultaneous observations of the transit in adjacent bands. We interpret this
additional dimming as absorption from sodium in the planetary atmosphere, as
recently predicted from several theoretical modeling efforts. Our model for a
cloudless planetary atmosphere with a solar abundance of sodium in atomic form
predicts more sodium absorption than we observe. There are several
possibilities that may account for this reduced amplitude, including reaction
of atomic sodium into molecular gases and/or condensates, photoionization of
sodium by the stellar flux, a low primordial abundance of sodium, or the
presence of clouds high in the atmosphere.


The Holographic Life of the eta'

  In the string holographic dual of large-N_c QCD with N_f flavours of
Kruczenski et al, the eta' meson is massless at infinite N_c and dual to a
collective fluctuation of N_f D6-brane probes in a supergravity background.
Here we identify the string diagrams responsible for the generation of a mass
of order N_f/N_c, consistent with the Witten-Veneziano formula, and show that
the supregravity limit of these diagrams corresponds to mixings with
pseudoscalar glueballs. We argue that the dependence on the theta-angle in the
supergravity description occurs only through the combination theta + 2
\sqrt{N_f} eta' / f_pi, as dictated by the U(1) anomaly. We provide a
quantitative test by computing the linear term in the eta' potential in two
independent ways, with perfect agreement.


Laser ablation loading of a surface-electrode ion trap

  We demonstrate loading by laser ablation of $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions into a
mm-scale surface-electrode ion trap. The laser used for ablation is a pulsed,
frequency-tripled Nd:YAG with pulse energies of 1-10 mJ and durations of 3-5
ns. An additional laser is not required to photoionize the ablated material.
The efficiency and lifetime of several candidate materials for the laser
ablation target are characterized by measuring the trapped ion fluorescence
signal for a number of consecutive loads. Additionally, laser ablation is used
to load traps with a trap depth (40 meV) below where electron impact ionization
loading is typically successful ($\gtrsim$ 500 meV).


Rational extensions of the quantum harmonic oscillator and exceptional
  Hermite polynomials

  We prove that every rational extension of the quantum harmonic oscillator
that is exactly solvable by polynomials is monodromy free, and therefore can be
obtained by applying a finite number of state-deleting Darboux transformations
on the harmonic oscillator. Equivalently, every exceptional orthogonal
polynomial system of Hermite type can be obtained by applying a Darboux-Crum
transformation to the classical Hermite polynomials. Exceptional Hermite
polynomial systems only exist for even codimension 2m, and they are indexed by
the partitions \lambda of m. We provide explicit expressions for their
corresponding orthogonality weights and differential operators and a separate
proof of their completeness. Exceptional Hermite polynomials satisfy a 2l+3
recurrence relation where l is the length of the partition \lambda. Explicit
expressions for such recurrence relations are given.


Asymptotically perfect efficient quantum state transfer across uniform
  chains with two impurities

  The ability to transfer quantum information from one location to another with
high fidelity is of central importance to quantum information science.
Unfortunately for the simplest system of a uniform chain (a spin chain or a
particle in a one-dimensional lattice), the state transfer time grows
exponentially in the chain length $N$ at fixed fidelity. In this work we show
that the addition of an impurity near each endpoint, coupled to the uniform
chain with strength $w$, is sufficient to ensure efficient and high-fidelity
state transfer. An eigenstate localized in the vicinity of the impurity can be
tuned into resonance with chain extended states by tuning $w(N)\propto
N^{1/2}$; the resulting avoided crossing yields resonant eigenstates with large
amplitudes on the chain endpoints and approximately equidistant eigenvalues.
The state transfer time scales as $t\propto N^{3/2}$ and its fidelity $F$
approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$; the error scales as
$1-F\propto N^{-1}$. Thus, with the addition of two impurities, asymptotically
perfect state transfer with a uniform chain is possible even in the absence of
external control.


Direct single-shot observation of millimeter wave superradiance in
  Rydberg-Rydberg transitions

  We have directly detected millimeter wave (mm-wave) free space superradiant
emission from Rydberg states ($n \sim 30$) of barium atoms in a single shot. We
trigger the cooperative effects with a weak initial pulse and detect with
single-shot sensitivity and 20 ps time resolution, which allows measurement and
shot-by-shot analysis of the distribution of decay rates, time delays, and
time-dependent frequency shifts. Cooperative line shifts and decay rates are
observed that exceed values that would correspond to the Doppler width of 250
kHz by a factor of 20 and the spontaneous emission rate of 50 Hz by a factor of
$10^5$. The initial superradiant output pulse is followed by evolution of the
radiation-coupled many-body system toward complex long-lasting emission modes.
A comparison to a mean-field theory is presented which reproduces the
quantitative time-domain results, but fails to account for either the
frequency-domain observations or the long-lived features.


Two dimensional ordering and collective magnetic excitations in the
  dilute ferromagnetic topological insulator
  (Bi$_{0.95}$Mn$_{0.05}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$

  Employing elastic and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) techniques, we
report on detailed microscopic properties of the ferromagnetism in he magnetic
topological insulator (Bi$_{0.95}$Mn$_{0.05}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. Neutron
diffraction of polycrystalline samples show the ferromagnetic (FM) ordering is
long-range within the basal plane, and mainly 2D in character with short-range
correlations between layers below $T_{\mathrm{C}} \approx 13$ K. Despite the
random distribution of the dliute Mn atoms, we find that the 2D-like magnetic
peaks are commensurate with the chemical structure, and the absence of (00L)
magnetic peaks denote that the Mn$^{2+}$ magnetic moments are normal to the
basal planes. Surprisingly, we observed collective magnetic excitations, in
this dilute magnetic system. Despite the dilute nature, the excitations are
typical of quasi-2D FM systems, albeit are severely broadened at short
wavelengths, likely due to the random spatial distribution of Mn atoms in the
Bi planes. Detailed analysis of the INS provide energy scales of the exchange
couplings and the single ion anisotropy.

Hydra II: a faint and compact Milky Way dwarf galaxy found in the Survey
  of the Magellanic Stellar History

  We present the discovery of a new dwarf galaxy, Hydra II, found
serendipitously within the data from the ongoing Survey of the MAgellanic
Stellar History (SMASH) conducted with the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco 4m
Telescope. The new satellite is compact (r_h = 68 +/- 11 pc) and faint (M_V =
-4.8 +/- 0.3), but well within the realm of dwarf galaxies. The stellar
distribution of HydraII in the color-magnitude diagram is well-described by a
metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.2) and old (13 Gyr) isochrone and shows a distinct blue
horizontal branch, some possible red clump stars, and faint stars that are
suggestive of blue stragglers. At a heliocentric distance of 134 +/- 10 kpc,
Hydra II is located in a region of the Galactic halo that models have suggested
may host material from the leading arm of the Magellanic Stream. A comparison
with N-body simulations hints that the new dwarf galaxy could be or could have
been a satellite of the Magellanic Clouds.


Power generation from a radiative thermal source using a large-area
  infrared rectenna

  Electrical power generation from a moderate temperature thermal source by
means of direct conversion of infrared radiation is important and highly
desirable for energy harvesting from waste heat and micropower applications.
Here, we demonstrate direct rectified power generation from an unbiased
large-area nanoantenna-coupled tunnel diode rectifier, called a rectenna. Using
a vacuum radiometric measurement technique with irradiation from a
temperature-stabilized thermal source, a generated power density of 8 nW/cm$^2$
is observed at a source temperature of 450C for the unbiased rectenna across an
optimized load resistance. The optimized load resistance for the peak power
generation for each temperature coincides with the tunnel diode resistance at
zero bias and corresponds to the impedance matching condition for a rectifying
antenna. Current voltage measurements of a thermally illuminated large-area
rectenna show current zero crossing shifts into the second quadrant indicating
rectification. Photon-assisted tunneling in the unbiased rectenna is modeled as
the mechanism for the large short-circuit photocurrents observed where the
photon energy serves as an effective bias across the tunnel junction. The
measured current and voltage across the load resistor as a function of the
thermal source temperature represents direct current electrical power
generation.


Spectral Typing of Late Type Stellar Companions to Young Stars from Low
  Dispersion Near-Infrared Integral Field Unit Data

  We used the Project 1640 near-infrared coronagraph and integral field
spectrograph to observe 19 young solar type stars. Five of these stars are
known binary stars and we detected the late-type secondaries and were able to
measure their JH spectra with a resolution of R\sim30. The reduced, extracted,
and calibrated spectra were compared to template spectra from the IRTF spectral
library. With this comparison we test the accuracy and consistency of spectral
type determination with the low-resolution near-infrared spectra from P1640.
Additionally, we determine effective temperature and surface gravity of the
companions by fitting synthetic spectra calculated with the PHOENIX model
atmosphere code. We also present several new epochs of astrometry of each of
the systems. Together these data increase our knowledge and understanding of
the stellar make up of these systems. In addition to the astronomical results,
the analysis presented helps validate the Project 1640 data reduction and
spectral extraction processes and the utility of low-resolution, near-infrared
spectra for characterizing late-type companions in multiple systems.


Low Frequency Imaging of Fields at High Galactic Latitude with the
  Murchison Widefield Array 32-Element Prototype

  The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a new low-frequency, wide
field-of-view radio interferometer under development at the Murchison
Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia. We have used a
32-element MWA prototype interferometer (MWA-32T) to observe two 50-degree
diameter fields in the southern sky in the 110 MHz to 200 MHz band in order to
evaluate the performance of the MWA-32T, to develop techniques for epoch of
reionization experiments, and to make measurements of astronomical foregrounds.
We developed a calibration and imaging pipeline for the MWA-32T, and used it to
produce ~15' angular resolution maps of the two fields. We perform a blind
source extraction using these confusion-limited images, and detect 655 sources
at high significance with an additional 871 lower significance source
candidates. We compare these sources with existing low-frequency radio surveys
in order to assess the MWA-32T system performance, wide field analysis
algorithms, and catalog quality. Our source catalog is found to agree well with
existing low-frequency surveys in these regions of the sky and with statistical
distributions of point sources derived from Northern Hemisphere surveys; it
represents one of the deepest surveys to date of this sky field in the 110 MHz
to 200 MHz band.


HAT-P-31b,c: A Transiting, Eccentric, Hot Jupiter and a Long-Period,
  Massive Third-Body

  We report the discovery of HAT-P-31b, a transiting exoplanet orbiting the
V=11.660 dwarf star GSC 2099-00908. HAT-P-31b is the first HAT planet
discovered without any follow-up photometry, demonstrating the feasibility of a
new mode of operation for the HATNet project. The 2.17 Mj, 1.1Rj planet has a
period P = 5.0054 days and maintains an unusually high eccentricity of e =
0.2450+/-0.0045, determined through Keck, FIES and Subaru high precision radial
velocities. Detailed modeling of the radial velocities indicates an additional
quadratic residual trend in the data detected to very high confidence. We
interpret this trend as a long-period outer companion, HAT-P-31c, of minimum
mass 3.4Mj and period >2.8 years. Since current RVs span less than half an
orbital period, we are unable to determine the properties of HAT-P-31c to high
confidence. However, dynamical simulations of two possible configurations show
that orbital stability is to be expected. Further, if HAT-P-31c has non-zero
eccentricity, our simulations show that the eccentricity of HAT-P-31b is
actively driven by the presence of c, making HAT-P-31 a potentially intriguing
dynamical laboratory.


KELT-11b: A Highly Inflated Sub-Saturn Exoplanet Transiting the V=8
  Subgiant HD 93396

  We report the discovery of a transiting exoplanet, KELT-11b, orbiting the
bright ($V=8.0$) subgiant HD 93396. A global analysis of the system shows that
the host star is an evolved subgiant star with $T_{\rm eff} = 5370\pm51$ K,
$M_{*} = 1.438_{-0.052}^{+0.061} M_{\odot}$, $R_{*} = 2.72_{-0.17}^{+0.21}
R_{\odot}$, log $g_*= 3.727_{-0.046}^{+0.040}$, and [Fe/H]$ = 0.180\pm0.075$.
The planet is a low-mass gas giant in a $P = 4.736529\pm0.00006$ day orbit,
with $M_{P} = 0.195\pm0.018 M_J$, $R_{P}= 1.37_{-0.12}^{+0.15} R_J$, $\rho_{P}
= 0.093_{-0.024}^{+0.028}$ g cm$^{-3}$, surface gravity log ${g_{P}} =
2.407_{-0.086}^{+0.080}$, and equilibrium temperature $T_{eq} =
1712_{-46}^{+51}$ K. KELT-11 is the brightest known transiting exoplanet host
in the southern hemisphere by more than a magnitude, and is the 6th brightest
transit host to date. The planet is one of the most inflated planets known,
with an exceptionally large atmospheric scale height (2763 km), and an
associated size of the expected atmospheric transmission signal of 5.6%. These
attributes make the KELT-11 system a valuable target for follow-up and
atmospheric characterization, and it promises to become one of the benchmark
systems for the study of inflated exoplanets.


A Radio Counterpart for the Unidentified TeV Source HESS J1813-178: The
  Radio-Gamma-Ray Connection

  We discovered independently the shell-type supernova remnant G12.82-0.02,
recently reported by Brogan et al. (2005), which is coincident with the
unidentified TeV gamma-ray source revealed in the HESS survey of the Galactic
plane. Estimating the ambient starlight at the location of this source from the
integrated Ly alpha luminosity of the nearby H II region W33, we conclude that
inverse Compton emission is a viable explanation for the observed TeV emission.
Examining remnants in the survey of Aharonian et al. (2005a) including those
detected above 200 Gev and those not detected, we find a strikingly large range
of more than three orders of magnitude in the radio to TeV flux ratios. We
briefly explore the possible explanations of this range and the implications
for the TeV emission mechanism.


The FourStar Infrared Camera

  The FourStar infrared camera is a 1.0-2.5 micron (JHKs) near infrared camera
for the Magellan Baade 6.5m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory (Chile). It
is being built by Carnegie Observatories and the Instrument Development Group
at Johns Hopkins and is scheduled for completion in 2009. The instrument uses
four Teledyne HAWAII-2RG arrays that produce a 10.9 x 10.9 arcmin field of
view. The outstanding seeing at the Las Campanas site coupled with FourStar's
high sensitivity and large field of view will enable many new survey and
targeted science programs.


Magnetic and lattice coupling in single-crystal SrFe$_2$As$_2$: A
  neutron scattering study

  A detailed elastic neutron scattering study of the structural and magnetic
phase transitions in single-crystal SrFe$_2$As$_2$ reveals that the
orthorhombic (O)-tetragonal (T) and the antiferromagnetic transitions coincide
at $T_\texttt{O}$ = $T_\texttt{N}$ = (201.5 $\pm$ 0.25) K. The observation of
coexisting O-T phases over a finite temperature range at the transition and the
sudden onset of the O distortion provide strong evidences that the structural
transition is first order. The simultaneous appearance and disappearance within
0.5 K upon cooling and within 0.25 K upon warming, respectively, indicate that
the magnetic and structural transitions are intimately coupled. We find that
the hysteresis in the transition temperature extends over a 1-2 K range. Based
on the observation of a remnant orthorhombic phase at temperatures higher than
\emph{T}$_\texttt{O}$, we suggest that the T-O transition may be an
order-disorder transition.


Deep borehole disposal of nuclear waste: US perspective

  Radioactive waste disposal in deep boreholes may be more "ready" than
disposal in mined geologic repositories since mankind has greater experience
operating small deep holes - boreholes, than big shallow holes - mines. There
are several thousand precedents for constructing >2 km deep boreholes and
several hundred precedents for disposing long-lived wastes in boreholes.
Borehole disposal is likely to be faster, cheaper, and more flexible than mined
disposal, while also offering greater long-term isolation. Isolation would rely
on the great depth, water density gradients, and reducing conditions to prevent
vertical movement of waste up the borehole.


Observation of squeezed light in the 2 $\mathrm{μm}$ region

  We present the generation and detection of squeezed light in the 2
$\mathrm{\mu m}$ wavelength region. This experiment is a crucial step in
realising the quantum noise reduction techniques that will be required for
future generations of gravitational-wave detectors. Squeezed vacuum is
generated via degenerate optical parametric oscillation from a
periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal, in a dual resonant
cavity. The experiment uses a frequency stabilised 1984 nm thulium fibre laser,
and squeezing is detected using balanced homodyne detection with extended
InGaAs photodiodes. We have measured $4.0 \pm 0.1$ dB of squeezing and $10.5
\pm 0.5$ dB of anti-squeezing relative to the shot noise level in the audio
frequency band, limited by photodiode quantum efficiency. The inferred
squeezing level directly after the optical parametric oscillator, after
accounting for known losses and phase noise, is 10.7 dB.
