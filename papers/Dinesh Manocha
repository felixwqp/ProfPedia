Incomparison to previous geometric acoustic methods, we achieve a speedup of overan order of magnitude while delivering similar audio to high-qualityconvolution rendering algorithms. As a result, our approach is the firstcapable of rendering plausible dynamic sound propagation effects on commoditysmartphones.

Thesepsychological characteristics are used for long-term path prediction andgenerating proximic characteristics for each pedestrian. We combine thesepsychological constraints with social constraints to perform human-aware robotnavigation in low- to medium-density crowds. The estimation of time-varyingbehaviors and pedestrian personalities can improve the performance of long-termpath prediction by 21%, as compared to prior interactive path predictionalgorithms. We also demonstrate the benefits of our socially-aware navigationin simulated environments with tens of pedestrians.

Leveraging Long-Term Predictions and Online-Learning in Agent-based  Multiple Person Tracking

  We present a multiple-person tracking algorithm, based on combining particlefilters and RVO, an agent-based crowd model that infers collision-freevelocities so as to predict pedestrian's motion. In addition to position andvelocity, our tracking algorithm can estimate the internal goals (desireddestination or desired velocity) of the tracked pedestrian in an online manner,thus removing the need to specify this information beforehand. Furthermore, weleverage the longer-term predictions of RVO by deriving a higher-order particlefilter, which aggregates multiple predictions from different prior time steps.This yields a tracker that can recover from short-term occlusions and spuriousnoise in the appearance model. Experimental results show that our trackingalgorithm is suitable for predicting pedestrians' behaviors online withoutneeding scene priors or hand-annotated goal information, and improves trackingin real-world crowded scenes under low frame rates.

Additionally, we use a new high-definition crowd videodataset, which is used to evaluate the performance of different pedestriantracking algorithms. This dataset consists of videos of indoor and outdoorscenes, recorded at different locations with 30-80 pedestrians. We highlightthe performance benefits of our algorithm over prior techniques using thisdataset. In practice, our algorithm can compute trajectories of tens ofpedestrians on a multi-core desktop CPU at interactive rates (27-30 frames persecond). To the best of our knowledge, our approach is 4-5 times faster thanprior methods, which provide similar accuracy.

Tracing Analytic Ray Curves for Light and Sound Propagation in  Non-linear Media

  The physical world consists of spatially varying media, such as theatmosphere and the ocean, in which light and sound propagates along non-lineartrajectories. This presents a challenge to existing ray-tracing based methods,which are widely adopted to simulate propagation due to their efficiency andflexibility, but assume linear rays. We present a novel algorithm that tracesanalytic ray curves computed from local media gradients, and utilizes theclosed-form solutions of both the intersections of the ray curves with planarsurfaces, and the travel distance. By constructing an adaptive unstructuredmesh, our algorithm is able to model general media profiles that vary in threedimensions with complex boundaries consisting of terrains and other sceneobjects such as buildings. We trace the analytic ray curves using the adaptiveunstructured mesh, which considerably improves the efficiency over priormethods. We highlight the algorithm's application on simulation of sound andvisual propagation in outdoor scenes.

We automaticallycompute the optimal parameters for each of these different models based onprior tracked data and use the best model as motion prior for ourparticle-filter based tracking algorithm. We also use our "mixture of motionmodels" for adaptive particle selection and accelerate the performance of theonline tracking algorithm. The motion model parameter estimation is formulatedas an optimization problem, and we use an approach that solves thiscombinatorial optimization problem in a model independent manner and hencescalable to any multi-agent pedestrian motion model. We evaluate theperformance of our approach on different crowd video datasets and highlight theimprovement in accuracy over homogeneous motion models and a baselinemean-shift based tracker. In practice, our formulation can compute trajectoriesof tens of pedestrians on a multi-core desktop CPU in in real time and offerhigher accuracy as compared to prior real time pedestrian tracking algorithms.

  We present a novel method to compute the approximate global penetration depth(PD) between two non-convex geometric models. Our approach consists of twophases: offline precomputation and run-time queries. In the first phase, ourformulation uses a novel sampling algorithm to precompute an approximation ofthe high-dimensional contact space between the pair of models. As compared withprior random sampling algorithms for contact space approximation, ourpropagation sampling considerably speeds up the precomputation and yields ahigh quality approximation. At run-time, we perform a nearest-neighbor queryand local projection to efficiently compute the translational or generalizedPD. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on complex 3D benchmarkswith tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles, and we observe significantimprovement over previous methods in terms of accuracy, with a modestimprovement in the run-time performance.

  We present an optimization-based motion planning algorithm to compute asmooth, collision-free trajectory for a manipulator used to transfer a liquidfrom a source to a target container. We take into account fluid dynamicsconstraints as part of trajectory computation. In order to avoid the highcomplexity of exact fluid simulation, we introduce a simplified dynamics modelbased on physically inspired approximations and system identification. Ouroptimization approach can incorporate various other constraints such ascollision avoidance with the obstacles, kinematic and dynamics constraints ofthe manipulator, and fluid dynamics characteristics. We demonstrate theperformance of our planner on different benchmarks corresponding to variousobstacles and container shapes. Furthermore, we also evaluate its accuracy byvalidating the motion plan using an accurate but computationally costlyNavier-Stokes fluid simulation.

Exemplar-AMMs: Recognizing Crowd Movements from Pedestrian Trajectories

  In this paper, we present a novel method to recognize the types of crowdmovement from crowd trajectories using agent-based motion models (AMMs). Ouridea is to apply a number of AMMs, referred to as exemplar-AMMs, to describethe crowd movement. Specifically, we propose an optimization framework thatfilters out the unknown noise in the crowd trajectories and measures theirsimilarity to the exemplar-AMMs to produce a crowd motion feature. We thenaddress our real-world crowd movement recognition problem as a multi-labelclassification problem. Our experiments show that the proposed featureoutperforms the state-of-the-art methods in recognizing both simulated andreal-world crowd movements from their trajectories. Finally, we have created asynthetic dataset, SynCrowd, which contains 2D crowd trajectories in variousscenarios, generated by various crowd simulators. This dataset can serve as atraining set or benchmark for crowd analysis work.

Our approach formulates this control problem as aPDE constrained spacetime optimization and computes locally optimal controlforces as the stationary point of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. In orderto reduce the high complexity of multiple passes of fluid resimulation, weutilize the coherence between consecutive fluid simulation passes and updateour solution using a novel spacetime full approximation scheme (STFAS). Wedemonstrate the benefits of our approach by computing accurate solutions on 2Dand 3D benchmarks. In practice, we observe more than an order of magnitudeimprovement over prior methods.

Chance constraint based multi agent navigation under uncertainty

  We present Probabilistic Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle or PRVO as a generalalgorithm for navigating multiple robots under perception and motionuncertainty. PRVO is defined as the space of velocities that ensures dynamiccollision avoidance between a pair of robots with a specified probability. Ourapproach is based on defining chance constraints over the inequalities definedby the deterministic Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle (RVO). The computationalcomplexity of the proposed probabilistic RVO is comparable to the deterministiccounterpart. This is achieved by a series of reformulations where we firstsubstitute the computationally intractable chance constraints with a family ofsurrogate constraints and then adopt a time scaling based solution methodologyto efficiently characterize their solution space. Further, we also show thatthe solution space of each member of the family of surrogate constraints can bemapped in closed form to the probability with which the original chanceconstraints are satisfied and thus consequently to probability of collisionavoidance. We validate our formulations through numerical simulations where wehighlight the importance of incorporating the effect of motion uncertainty andthe advantages of PRVO over existing formulations which handles the effect ofuncertainty by using conservative bounding volumes.

Recurrent 3D Attentional Networks for End-to-End Active Object  Recognition

  Active vision is inherently attention-driven: The agent actively selectsviews to attend in order to fast achieve the vision task while improving itsinternal representation of the scene being observed. Inspired by the recentsuccess of attention-based models in 2D vision tasks based on single RGBimages, we propose to address the multi-view depth-based active objectrecognition using attention mechanism, through developing an end-to-endrecurrent 3D attentional network. The architecture takes advantage of arecurrent neural network (RNN) to store and update an internal representation.Our model, trained with 3D shape datasets, is able to iteratively attend to thebest views targeting an object of interest for recognizing it. To realize 3Dview selection, we derive a 3D spatial transformer network which isdifferentiable for training with backpropagation, achieving much fasterconvergence than the reinforcement learning employed by most existingattention-based models. Experiments show that our method, with only depthinput, achieves state-of-the-art next-best-view performance in time efficiencyand recognition accuracy.

We take into account various trafficconstraints, including collision avoidance with other vehicles, pedestrians,and cyclists using control velocity obstacles. We use a data-driven approach tomodel the vehicle dynamics for control and collision avoidance. Furthermore,our trajectory computation algorithm takes into account traffic rules andbehaviors, such as stopping at intersections and stoplights, based on anarc-spline representation. We have evaluated our algorithm in a simulatedenvironment and tested its interactive performance in urban and highway drivingscenarios with tens of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. These scenariosinclude jaywalking pedestrians, sudden stops from high speeds, safely passingcyclists, a vehicle suddenly swerving into the roadway, and high-densitytraffic where the vehicle must change lanes to progress more effectively.

Effects of virtual acoustics on dynamic auditory distance perception

  Sound propagation encompasses various acoustic phenomena includingreverberation. Current virtual acoustic methods, ranging from parametricfilters to physically-accurate solvers, can simulate reverberation with varyingdegrees of fidelity. We investigate the effects of reverberant sounds generatedusing different propagation algorithms on acoustic distance perception, i.e.,how faraway humans perceive a sound source. In particular, we evaluate twoclasses of methods for real-time sound propagation in dynamic scenes based onparametric filters and ray tracing. Our study shows that the more accuratemethod shows less distance compression as compared to the approximate,filter-based method. This suggests that accurate reverberation in VR results ina better reproduction of acoustic distances. We also quantify the levels ofdistance compression introduced by different propagation methods in a virtualenvironment.

  We present an algorithm for combining natural language processing (NLP) andfast robot motion planning to automatically generate robot movements. Ourformulation uses a novel concept called Dynamic Constraint Mapping to transformcomplex, attribute-based natural language instructions into appropriate costfunctions and parametric constraints for optimization-based motion planning. Wegenerate a factor graph from natural language instructions called the DynamicGrounding Graph (DGG), which takes latent parameters into account. Thecoefficients of this factor graph are learned based on conditional randomfields (CRFs) and are used to dynamically generate the constraints for motionplanning. We map the cost function directly to the motion parameters of theplanner and compute smooth trajectories in dynamic scenes. We highlight theperformance of our approach in a simulated environment and via a humaninteracting with a 7-DOF Fetch robot using intricate language commandsincluding negation, orientation specification, and distance constraints.

  We present a new method for training pedestrian detectors on an unannotatedset of images. We produce a mixed reality dataset that is composed ofreal-world background images and synthetically generated static human-agents.Our approach is general, robust, and makes no other assumptions about theunannotated dataset regarding the number or location of pedestrians. Weautomatically extract from the dataset: i) the vanishing point to calibrate thevirtual camera, and ii) the pedestrians' scales to generate a Spawn ProbabilityMap, which is a novel concept that guides our algorithm to place thepedestrians at appropriate locations. After putting synthetic human-agents inthe unannotated images, we use these augmented images to train a PedestrianDetector, with the annotations generated along with the synthetic agents. Weconducted our experiments using Faster R-CNN by comparing the detection resultson the unannotated dataset performed by the detector trained using our approachand detectors trained with other manually labeled datasets. We showed that ourapproach improves the average precision by 5-13% over these detectors.

Ourapproach can model the interactions between the body and the environment andautomatically generate active animations. We model the frictional contactforces using contact invariant optimization and the fluid drag forces using asimplified model. To handle complex objects, we use a reduced deformable modeland present a novel hybrid optimizer to search for the local minimaefficiently. This allows us to use long-horizon motion planning toautomatically generate animations such as walking, jumping, swimming, androlling. We evaluate the approach on different shapes and animations, includingdeformable body navigation and combining with an open-loop controller forrealtime forward simulation.

  The complex physical properties of highly deformable materials such asclothes pose significant challenges fanipulation systems. We present a novelvisual feedback dictionary-based method for manipulating defoor autonomousrobotic mrmable objects towards a desired configuration. Our approach is basedon visual servoing and we use an efficient technique to extract key featuresfrom the RGB sensor stream in the form of a histogram of deformable modelfeatures. These histogram features serve as high-level representations of thestate of the deformable material. Next, we collect manipulation data and use avisual feedback dictionary that maps the velocity in the high-dimensionalfeature space to the velocity of the robotic end-effectors for manipulation. Wehave evaluated our approach on a set of complex manipulation tasks andhuman-robot manipulation tasks on different cloth pieces with varying materialcharacteristics.

Reflection-Aware Sound Source Localization

  We present a novel, reflection-aware method for 3D sound localization inindoor environments. Unlike prior approaches, which are mainly based oncontinuous sound signals from a stationary source, our formulation is designedto localize the position instantaneously from signals within a single frame. Weconsider direct sound and indirect sound signals that reach the microphonesafter reflecting off surfaces such as ceilings or walls. We then generate andtrace direct and reflected acoustic paths using inverse acoustic ray tracingand utilize these paths with Monte Carlo localization to estimate a 3D soundsource position. We have implemented our method on a robot with a cube-shapedmicrophone array and tested it against different settings with continuous andintermittent sound signals with a stationary or a mobile source. Acrossdifferent settings, our approach can localize the sound with an averagedistance error of 0.8m tested in a room of 7m by 7m area with 3m height,including a mobile and non-line-of-sight sound source. We also reveal that themodeling of indirect rays increases the localization accuracy by 40% comparedto only using direct acoustic rays.

A unified crowd simulation model revealing relationships among  "Physiology-Psychology-Physics" factors

  We present a unified model for crowd simulation, CubeP, which comprehensivelyconsiders physiological, psychological, and physical factors. Inspired by thetheory of "the devoted actor," the movements of each individual in our modelare determined by modeling the physical influence of physical strengthconsumption and the emotion of panic. In particular, human physical strengthconsumption is computed using a physics-based numerical method. Inspired by theJames-Lange theory, panic emotion is estimated by means of an enhancedemotional contagion model that leverages the inherent relation between physicalstrength consumption and panic emotion. To the best of our knowledge, our modelis the first method that integrates physiological, psychological, and physicalfactors together and exploits the relationship between these factors. Wehighlight the performance on different scenarios and compare the resultingbehavior with real-world video sequences. Our approach can reliably predict thechanges in physical strength consumption and panic emotion of individuals in anemergency situation.

Cloth Manipulation Using Random-Forest-Based Imitation Learning

  We present a novel approach for robust manipulation of high-DOF deformableobjects such as cloth. Our approach uses a random forest-based controller thatmaps the observed visual features of the cloth to an optimal control action ofthe manipulator. The topological structure of this random forest-basedcontroller is determined automatically based on the training data consistingvisual features and optimal control actions. This enables us to integrate theoverall process of training data classification and controller optimizationinto an imitation learning (IL) approach. Our approach enables learning ofrobust control policy for cloth manipulation with guarantees on convergence.Wehave evaluated our approach on different multi-task cloth manipulationbenchmarks such as flattening, folding and twisting. In practice, our approachworks well with different deformable features learned based on the specifictask or deep learning. Moreover, our controller outperforms a simple orpiecewise linear controller in terms of robustness to noise. In addition, ourapproach is easy to implement and does not require much parameter tuning.

We present a novel CTMATrepresentation based on medial axis transform to compute a tight fittingbounding shape for each agent. Each CTMAT is represented using tuples, whichare composed of circular arcs and line segments. Based on the reciprocalvelocity obstacle formulation, we reduce the problem to solving alow-dimensional linear programming between each pair of tuples belonging toadjacent agents. We precompute the Minkowski Sums of tuples to accelerate theruntime performance. Finally, we provide an efficient method to update theorientation of each agent in a local manner. We have implemented the algorithmand highlight its performance on benchmarks corresponding to road trafficscenarios and different vehicles. The overall runtime performance is comparableto prior multi-agent collision avoidance algorithms that use circular orelliptical agents. Our approach is less conservative and results in fewer falsecollisions.

  We present a real-time, data-driven algorithm to enhance thesocial-invisibility of robots within crowds. Our approach is based on priorpsychological research, which reveals that people noticeand--importantly--react negatively to groups of social actors when they havehigh entitativity, moving in a tight group with similar appearances andtrajectories. In order to evaluate that behavior, we performed a user study todevelop navigational algorithms that minimize entitativity. This studyestablishes a mapping between emotional reactions and multi-robot trajectoriesand appearances and further generalizes the finding across variousenvironmental conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of our entitativitymodeling for trajectory computation for active surveillance and dynamicintervention in simulated robot-human interaction scenarios. Our approachempirically shows that various levels of entitative robots can be used to bothavoid and influence pedestrians while not eliciting strong emotional reactions,giving multi-robot systems socially-invisibility.

Our technique uses a sound propagation optimizationformulation to maximize the Speech Transmission Index (STI) by computing anoptimal location of the sound receiver. We use an efficient and accurate hybridsound propagation technique on complex 3D models to compute the Room ImpulseResponses (RIR) and evaluate their impact on the STI. The overall algorithmcomputes a globally optimal position of the receiver that reduces the effectsof reverberation and noise over many source positions. We evaluate ouralgorithm on various indoor 3D models, all showing significant improvement inSTI, based on accurate sound propagation.

PORCA: Modeling and Planning for Autonomous Driving among Many  Pedestrians

  This paper presents a planning system for autonomous driving among manypedestrians. A key ingredient of our approach is PORCA, a pedestrian motionprediction model that accounts for both a pedestrian's global navigationintention and local interactions with the vehicle and other pedestrians.Unfortunately, the autonomous vehicle does not know the pedestrian's intentiona priori and requires a planning algorithm that hedges against the uncertaintyin pedestrian intentions. Our planning system combines a POMDP algorithm withthe pedestrian motion model and runs in near real time. Experiments show thatit enables a robot vehicle to drive safely, efficiently, and smoothly among acrowd with a density of nearly one person per square meter.

We build bijective contactmapping between these model parts and compute the corresponding grasps fornovel objects. Finally, we assemble the individual parts and use localreplanning to adjust grasp configurations while maintaining its stability andphysical constraints. Our approach is general, can handle all kind of objectsrepresented using mesh or point cloud and a variety of robotic hands.

As compared to prior techniques based on exactdynamic function computation, we observe one to two orders of magnitudeimprovement in performance.

Data-Driven Modeling of Group Entitativity in Virtual Environments

  We present a data-driven algorithm to model and predict the socio-emotionalimpact of groups on observers. Psychological research finds that highlyentitative i.e. cohesive and uniform groups induce threat and unease inobservers. Our algorithm models realistic trajectory-level behaviors toclassify and map the motion-based entitativity of crowds. This mapping is basedon a statistical scheme that dynamically learns pedestrian behavior andcomputes the resultant entitativity induced emotion through group motioncharacteristics. We also present a novel interactive multi-agent simulationalgorithm to model entitative groups and conduct a VR user study to validatethe socio-emotional predictive power of our algorithm. We further show thatmodel-generated high-entitativity groups do induce more negative emotions thanlow-entitative groups.

Pedestrian Dominance Modeling for Socially-Aware Robot Navigation

  We present a Pedestrian Dominance Model (PDM) to identify the dominancecharacteristics of pedestrians for robot navigation. Through a perception studyon a simulated dataset of pedestrians, PDM models the perceived dominancelevels of pedestrians with varying motion behaviors corresponding totrajectory, speed, and personal space. At runtime, we use PDM to identify thedominance levels of pedestrians to facilitate socially-aware navigation for therobots. PDM can predict dominance levels from trajectories with ~85% accuracy.Prior studies in psychology literature indicate that when interacting withhumans, people are more comfortable around people that exhibit complementarymovement behaviors. Our algorithm leverages this by enabling the robots toexhibit complementing responses to pedestrian dominance. We also present anapplication of PDM for generating dominance-based collision-avoidance behaviorsin the navigation of autonomous vehicles among pedestrians. We demonstrate thebenefits of our algorithm for robots navigating among tens of pedestrians insimulated environments.

VV-Net: Voxel VAE Net with Group Convolutions for Point Cloud  Segmentation

  We present a novel algorithm for point cloud segmentation. Our approach usesa radial basis function (RBF) based variational auto-encoder (VAE) network withgroup convolutions defined on $\mathbb{Z}^3$ to robustly segment point cloudswithout increasing the number of parameters. We transform unstructured pointclouds into regular voxel grids and use subvoxels within each voxel to encodethe local geometry using a VAE architecture. Traditionally, the voxelrepresentation only comprises Boolean occupancy information, which fails tocapture the sparsely distributed points within voxels in a compact manner. Inorder to handle sparse distribution of points within each voxel, we furtheremploy RBF to compute a local, continuous representation within each subvoxel.We extend group equivariant convolutions to 3D point cloud processing andincrease the expressive capacity of the neural network. The combination of RBFand VAE results in a good volumetric representation that can handle noisy pointcloud datasets and is more robust for learning. We highlight the performance onstandard benchmarks and compare with prior methods. In practice, our approachoutperforms state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on the ShapeNet and S3DISdatasets.

Heter-Sim: Heterogeneous multi-agent systems simulation by interactive  data-driven optimization

  Interactive multi-agent simulation algorithms are used to compute thetrajectories and behaviors of different entities in virtual reality scenarios.However, current methods involve considerable parameter tweaking to generateplausible behaviors. We introduce a novel approach (Heter-Sim) that combinesphysics-based simulation methods with data-driven techniques using anoptimization-based formulation. Our approach is general and can simulateheterogeneous agents corresponding to human crowds, traffic, vehicles, orcombinations of different agents with varying dynamics. We estimate motionstates from real-world datasets that include information about position,velocity, and control direction. Our optimization algorithm considers severalconstraints, including velocity continuity, collision avoidance, attraction,and direction control. To accelerate the computations, we reduce the searchspace for both collision avoidance and optimal solution computation. Heter-Simcan simulate tens or hundreds of agents at interactive rates and we compare itsaccuracy with real-world datasets and prior algorithms. We also perform userstudies that evaluate the plausible behaviors generated by our algorithm and auser study that evaluates the plausibility of our algorithm via VR.

TraPHic: Trajectory Prediction in Dense and Heterogeneous Traffic Using  Weighted Interactions

  We present a new algorithm for predicting the near-term trajectories ofroad-agents in dense traffic videos. Our approach is designed for heterogeneoustraffic, where the road-agents may correspond to buses, cars, scooters,bicycles, or pedestrians. We model the interactions between differentroad-agents using a novel LSTM-CNN hybrid network for trajectory prediction. Inparticular, we take into account heterogeneous interactions that implicitlyaccounts for the varying shapes, dynamics, and behaviors of different roadagents. In addition, we model horizon-based interactions which are used toimplicitly model the driving behavior of each road-agent. We evaluate theperformance of our prediction algorithm, TraPHic, on the standard datasets andalso introduce a new dense, heterogeneous traffic dataset corresponding tourban Asian videos and agent trajectories. We outperform state-of-the-artmethods on dense traffic datasets by 30%.

Modeling Data-Driven Dominance Traits for Virtual Characters using Gait  Analysis

  We present a data-driven algorithm for generating gaits of virtual characterswith varying dominance traits. Our formulation utilizes a user study toestablish a data-driven dominance mapping between gaits and dominance labels.We use our dominance mapping to generate walking gaits for virtual charactersthat exhibit a variety of dominance traits while interacting with the user.Furthermore, we extract gait features based on known criteria in visualperception and psychology literature that can be used to identify the dominancelevels of any walking gait. We validate our mapping and the perceived dominancetraits by a second user study in an immersive virtual environment. Our gaitdominance classification algorithm can classify the dominance traits of gaitswith ~73% accuracy. We also present an application of our approach thatsimulates interpersonal relationships between virtual characters. To the bestof our knowledge, ours is the first practical approach to classifying gaitdominance and generate dominance traits in virtual characters.

P-Reverb: Perceptual Characterization of Early and Late Reflections for  Auditory Displays

  We introduce a novel, perceptually derived metric (P-Reverb) that relates thejust-noticeable difference (JND) of the early sound field(also called earlyreflections) to the late sound field (known as late reflections orreverberation). Early and late reflections are crucial components of the soundfield and provide multiple perceptual cues for auditory displays. We conducttwo extensive user evaluations that relate the JNDs of early reflections andlate reverberation in terms of the mean-free path of the environment andpresent a novel P-Reverb metric. Our metric is used to estimate dynamicreverberation characteristics efficiently in terms of important parameters likereverberation time (RT60). We show the numerical accuracy of our P-Reverbmetric in estimating RT60. Finally, we use our metric to design an interactivesound propagation algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on variousbenchmarks.

LSwarm: Efficient Collision Avoidance for Large Swarms with Coverage  Constraints in Complex Urban Scenes

  In this paper, we address the problem of collision avoidance for a swarm ofUAVs used for continuous surveillance of an urban environment. Our method,LSwarm, efficiently avoids collisions with static obstacles, dynamic obstaclesand other agents in 3-D urban environments while considering coverageconstraints. LSwarm computes collision avoiding velocities that (i) maximizethe conformity of an agent to an optimal path given by a global coveragestrategy and (ii) ensure sufficient resolution of the coverage data collectedby each agent. Our algorithm is formulated based on ORCA (Optimal ReciprocalCollision Avoidance) and is scalable with respect to the size of the swarm. Weevaluate the coverage performance of LSwarm in realistic simulations of a swarmof quadrotors in complex urban models. In practice, our approach can computecollision avoiding velocities for a swarm composed of tens to hundreds ofagents in a few milliseconds on dense urban scenes consisting of tens ofbuildings.

Efficient Probabilistic Collision Detection for Non-Gaussian Noise  Distributions

  We present an efficient algorithm to compute tight upper bounds of collisionprobability between two objects with positional uncertainties, whose errordistributions are represented with non-Gaussian forms. Our approach can handlenoisy datasets from depth sensors, whose distributions may correspond toTruncated Gaussian, Weighted Samples, or Truncated Gaussian Mixture Model. Wederive tight probability bounds for convex shapes and extend them to non-convexshapes using hierarchical representations. We highlight the benefits of ourapproach over prior probabilistic collision detection algorithms in terms oftighter bounds (10x) and improved running time (3x). Moreover, we use our tightbounds to design an efficient and accurate motion planning algorithm for a7-DOF robot arm operating in tight scenarios with sensor and motionuncertainties.

The Emotionally Intelligent Robot: Improving Social Navigation in  Crowded Environments

  We present a real-time algorithm for emotion-aware navigation of a robotamong pedestrians. Our approach estimates time-varying emotional behaviors ofpedestrians from their faces and trajectories using a combination ofBayesian-inference, CNN-based learning, and the PAD(Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) model from psychology. These PAD characteristicsare used for long-term path prediction and generating proxemic constraints foreach pedestrian. We use a multi-channel model to classify pedestriancharacteristics into four emotion categories (happy, sad, angry, neutral). Inour validation results, we observe an emotion detection accuracy of 85.33%. Weformulate emotion-based proxemic constraints to perform socially-aware robotnavigation in low- to medium-density environments. We demonstrate the benefitsof our algorithm in simulated environments with tens of pedestrians as well asin a real-world setting with Pepper, a social humanoid robot.

PaintBot: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Natural Media Painting

  We propose a new automated digital painting framework, based on a paintingagent trained through reinforcement learning. To synthesize an image, the agentselects a sequence of continuous-valued actions representing primitive paintingstrokes, which are accumulated on a digital canvas. Action selection is guidedby a given reference image, which the agent attempts to replicate subject tothe limitations of the action space and the agent's learned policy. Thepainting agent policy is determined using a variant of proximal policyoptimization reinforcement learning. During training, our agent is presentedwith patches sampled from an ensemble of reference images. To acceleratetraining convergence, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy, wherebyreference patches are sampled according to how challenging they are using thecurrent policy. We experiment with differing loss functions, includingpixel-wise and perceptual loss, which have consequent differing effects on thelearned policy. We demonstrate that our painting agent can learn an effectivepolicy with a high dimensional continuous action space comprising pen pressure,width, tilt, and color, for a variety of painting styles. Through acoarse-to-fine refinement process our agent can paint arbitrarily compleximages in the desired style.
