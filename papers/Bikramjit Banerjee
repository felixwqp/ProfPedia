A Framework and Method for Online Inverse Reinforcement Learning

  Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the problem of learning the
preferences of an agent from the observations of its behavior on a task. While
this problem has been well investigated, the related problem of {\em online}
IRL---where the observations are incrementally accrued, yet the demands of the
application often prohibit a full rerun of an IRL method---has received
relatively less attention. We introduce the first formal framework for online
IRL, called incremental IRL (I2RL), and a new method that advances maximum
entropy IRL with hidden variables, to this setting. Our formal analysis shows
that the new method has a monotonically improving performance with more
demonstration data, as well as probabilistically bounded error, both under full
and partial observability. Experiments in a simulated robotic application of
penetrating a continuous patrol under occlusion shows the relatively improved
performance and speed up of the new method and validates the utility of online
IRL.
