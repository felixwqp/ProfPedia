Fitness Probability Distribution of Bit-Flip Mutation

  Bit-flip mutation is a common mutation operator for evolutionary algorithms
applied to optimize functions over binary strings. In this paper, we develop
results from the theory of landscapes and Krawtchouk polynomials to exactly
compute the probability distribution of fitness values of a binary string
undergoing uniform bit-flip mutation. We prove that this probability
distribution can be expressed as a polynomial in p, the probability of flipping
each bit. We analyze these polynomials and provide closed-form expressions for
an easy linear problem (Onemax), and an NP-hard problem, MAX-SAT. We also
discuss some implications of the results for runtime analysis.
