A Survey of the Usages of Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing

  Over the last several years, the field of natural language processing has
been propelled forward by an explosion in the use of deep learning models. This
survey provides a brief introduction to the field and a quick overview of deep
learning architectures and methods. It then sifts through the plethora of
recent studies and summarizes a large assortment of relevant contributions.
Analyzed research areas include several core linguistic processing issues in
addition to a number of applications of computational linguistics. A discussion
of the current state of the art is then provided along with recommendations for
future research in the field.
