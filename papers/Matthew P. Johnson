Patterns of Scalable Bayesian Inference

  Datasets are growing not just in size but in complexity, creating a demandfor rich models and quantification of uncertainty. Bayesian methods are anexcellent fit for this demand, but scaling Bayesian inference is a challenge.In response to this challenge, there has been considerable recent work based onvarying assumptions about model structure, underlying computational resources,and the importance of asymptotic correctness. As a result, there is a zoo ofideas with few clear overarching principles.  In this paper, we seek to identify unifying principles, patterns, andintuitions for scaling Bayesian inference. We review existing work on utilizingmodern computing resources with both MCMC and variational approximationtechniques. From this taxonomy of ideas, we characterize the general principlesthat have proven successful for designing scalable inference procedures andcomment on the path forward.

Deciding the Closure of Inconsistent Rooted Triples is NP-Complete

  Interpreting three-leaf binary trees or {\em rooted triples} as constraintsyields an entailment relation, whereby binary trees satisfying some rootedtriples must also thus satisfy others, and thence a closure operator, which isknown to be polynomial-time computable. This is extended to inconsistent triplesets by defining that a triple is entailed by such a set if it is entailed byany consistent subset of it.  Determining whether the closure of an inconsistent rooted triple set can becomputed in polynomial time was posed as an open problem in the Isaac NewtonInstitute's "Phylogenetics" program in 2007. It appears (as NC4) in acollection of such open problems maintained by Mike Steel, and it is the lastof that collection's five problems concerning computational complexity to haveremained open. We resolve the complexity of computing this closure, provingthat its decision version is NP-Complete.  In the process, we also prove that detecting the existence of {\em any}acyclic B-hyperpath (from specified source to destination) is NP-Complete, in asignificantly narrower special case than the version whose {\em minimization}problem was recently proven NP-hard by Ritz et al. This implies it is NP-hardto approximate (our special case of) their minimization problem to within {\emany} factor.

Red-Blue-Partitioned MST, TSP, and Matching

  Arkin et al.~\cite{ArkinBCCJKMM17} recently introduced \textit{partitionedpairs} network optimization problems: given a metric-weighted graph on $n$pairs of nodes, the task is to color one node from each pair red and the otherblue, and then to compute two separate \textit{network structures} or disjoint(node-covering) subgraphs of a specified sort, one on the graph induced by thered nodes and the other on the blue nodes. Three structures have beeninvestigated by \cite{ArkinBCCJKMM17}---\textit{spanning trees},\textit{traveling salesperson tours}, and \textit{perfect matchings}---and thethree objectives to optimize for when computing such pairs of structures:\textit{min-sum}, \textit{min-max}, and \textit{bottleneck}. We provideimproved approximation guarantees and/or strengthened hardness results forthese nine NP-hard problem settings.

Finding a Small Number of Colourful Components

  A partition $(V_1,\ldots,V_k)$ of the vertex set of a graph $G$ with a (notnecessarily proper) colouring $c$ is colourful if no two vertices in any $V_i$have the same colour and every set $V_i$ induces a connected graph. TheCOLOURFUL PARTITION problem is to decide whether a coloured graph $(G,c)$ has acolourful partition of size at most $k$. This problem is closely related to theCOLOURFUL COMPONENTS problem, which is to decide whether a graph can bemodified into a graph whose connected components form a colourful partition bydeleting at most $p$ edges. Nevertheless we show that COLOURFUL PARTITION andCOLOURFUL COMPONENTS may have different complexities for restricted instances.We tighten known NP-hardness results for both problems and in addition we provenew hardness and tractability results for COLOURFUL PARTITION. Using theseresults we complete our paper with a thorough parameterized study of COLOURFULPARTITION.

Composing graphical models with neural networks for structured  representations and fast inference

  We propose a general modeling and inference framework that composesprobabilistic graphical models with deep learning methods and combines theirrespective strengths. Our model family augments graphical structure in latentvariables with neural network observation models. For inference, we extendvariational autoencoders to use graphical model approximating distributionswith recognition networks that output conjugate potentials. All components ofthese models are learned simultaneously with a single objective, giving ascalable algorithm that leverages stochastic variational inference, naturalgradients, graphical model message passing, and the reparameterization trick.We illustrate this framework with several example models and an application tomouse behavioral phenotyping.

Multimodal Prediction and Personalization of Photo Edits with Deep  Generative Models

  Professional-grade software applications are powerful butcomplicated$-$expert users can achieve impressive results, but novices oftenstruggle to complete even basic tasks. Photo editing is a prime example: afterloading a photo, the user is confronted with an array of cryptic sliders like"clarity", "temp", and "highlights". An automatically generated suggestioncould help, but there is no single "correct" edit for a given image$-$differentexperts may make very different aesthetic decisions when faced with the sameimage, and a single expert may make different choices depending on the intendeduse of the image (or on a whim). We therefore want a system that can proposemultiple diverse, high-quality edits while also learning from and adapting to auser's aesthetic preferences. In this work, we develop a statistical model thatmeets these objectives. Our model builds on recent advances in neural networkgenerative modeling and scalable inference, and uses hierarchical structure tolearn editing patterns across many diverse users. Empirically, we find that ourmodel outperforms other approaches on this challenging multimodal predictiontask.

MIMIC-CXR: A large publicly available database of labeled chest  radiographs

  Chest radiography is an extremely powerful imaging modality, allowing for adetailed inspection of a patient's thorax, but requiring specialized trainingfor proper interpretation. With the advent of high performance general purposecomputer vision algorithms, the accurate automated analysis of chestradiographs is becoming increasingly of interest to researchers. However, a keychallenge in the development of these techniques is the lack of sufficientdata. Here we describe MIMIC-CXR, a large dataset of 371,920 chest x-raysassociated with 227,943 imaging studies sourced from the Beth Israel DeaconessMedical Center between 2011 - 2016. Each imaging study can pertain to one ormore images, but most often are associated with two images: a frontal view anda lateral view. Images are provided with 14 labels derived from a naturallanguage processing tool applied to the corresponding free-text radiologyreports. All images have been de-identified to protect patient privacy. Thedataset is made freely available to facilitate and encourage a wide range ofresearch in medical computer vision.

Dependent Multinomial Models Made Easy: Stick Breaking with the  Pólya-Gamma Augmentation

  Many practical modeling problems involve discrete data that are bestrepresented as draws from multinomial or categorical distributions. Forexample, nucleotides in a DNA sequence, children's names in a given state andyear, and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomialdistributions. In all of these cases, we expect some form of dependency betweenthe draws: the nucleotide at one position in the DNA strand may depend on thepreceding nucleotides, children's names are highly correlated from year toyear, and topics in text may be correlated and dynamic. These dependencies arenot naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation. Here,we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations inP\'olya-gamma augmentation to reformulate the multinomial distribution in termsof latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods, enabling us to takeadvantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models withminimal overhead.

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Galaxies at z~0.1: the Effect of  Star Formation and AGN

  We present the analysis of the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) spectraof a sample of 92 typical star forming galaxies at 0.03 < z < 0.2 observed withthe Spitzer IRS. We compare the relative strengths of PAH emission featureswith SDSS optical diagnostics to probe the relationship between PAH grainproperties and star formation and AGN activity. Short-to-long wavelength PAHratios, and in particular the 7.7-to-11.3 micron feature ratio, are stronglycorrelated with the star formation diagnostics D_n(4000) and H-alpha equivalentwidth, increasing with younger stellar populations. This ratio also shows asignificant difference between active and non-active galaxies, with the activegalaxies exhibiting weaker 7.7 micron emission. A hard radiation field asmeasured by [OIII]/H-beta and [NeIII]_15.6/[NeII]_12.8 affects PAH ratiosdifferently depending on whether this field results from starburst activity oran AGN. Our results are consistent with a picture in which larger PAH moleculesgrow more efficiently in richer media and in which smaller PAH molecules arepreferentially destroyed by AGN.

Winning versus losing during gambling and its neural correlates

  Humans often make decisions which maximize an internal utility function. Forexample, humans often maximize their expected reward when gambling and this isconsidered as a "rational" decision. However, humans tend to change theirbetting strategies depending on how they "feel". If someone has experienced alosing streak, they may "feel" that they are more likely to win on the nexthand even though the odds of the game have not changed. That is, theirdecisions are driven by their emotional state. In this paper, we investigatehow the human brain responds to wins and losses during gambling. Using acombination of local field potential recordings in human subjects performing afinancial decision-making task, spectral analyses, and non-parametric clusterstatistics, we investigated whether neural responses in different cognitive andlimbic brain areas differ between wins and losses after decisions are made. Ineleven subjects, the neural activity modulated significantly between win andloss trials in one brain region: the anterior insula ($p=0.01$). In particular,gamma activity (30-70 Hz) increased in the anterior insula when subjects justrealized that they won. Modulation of metabolic activity in the anterior insulahas been observed previously in functional magnetic resonance imaging studiesduring decision making and when emotions are elicited. However, our study isable to characterize temporal dynamics of electrical activity in this brainregion at the millisecond resolution while decisions are made and afteroutcomes are revealed.

Comet 322P/SOHO 1: An asteroid with the smallest perihelion distance?

  We observed comet 322P/SOHO 1 (P/1999 R1) from the ground and with theSpitzer Space Telescope when it was between 2.2 and 1.2 AU from the Sun. Theseare the first observations of any SOHO-discovered periodic comet by a non-solarobservatory, and allow us to investigate its behavior under typical cometarycircumstances. 322P appeared inactive in all images. Its lightcurve suggests arotation period of 2.8+/-0.3 hr and has an amplitude greater than ~0.3 mag,implying a density of at least 1000 kg m$^{-3}$, considerably higher than thatof any known comet. It has average colors of g'-r' = 0.52+/-0.04 and r'-i' =0.04+/-0.09. We converted these to Johnson colors and found that the V-R coloris consistent with average cometary colors, but R-I is somewhat bluer; thesecolors are most similar to V- and Q-type asteroids. Modeling of the optical andIR photometry suggests it has a diameter of 150-320 m and a geometric albedo of0.09-0.42, with diameter and albedo inversely related. Our upper limits to anyundetected coma are still consistent with a sublimation lifetime shorter thanthe typical dynamical lifetimes for Jupiter Family Comets. These resultssuggest that it may be of asteroidal origin and only active in the SOHO fieldsof view via processes different from the volatile-driven activity oftraditional comets. If so, it has the smallest perihelion distance of any knownasteroid.

Funding Games: the Truth but not the Whole Truth

  We introduce the Funding Game, in which $m$ identical resources are to beallocated among $n$ selfish agents. Each agent requests a number of resources$x_i$ and reports a valuation $\tilde{v}_i(x_i)$, which verifiably {\emlower}-bounds $i$'s true value for receiving $x_i$ items. The pairs $(x_i,\tilde{v}_i(x_i))$ can be thought of as size-value pairs defining a knapsackproblem with capacity $m$. A publicly-known algorithm is used to solve thisknapsack problem, deciding which requests to satisfy in order to maximize thesocial welfare.  We show that a simple mechanism based on the knapsack {\it highest ratiogreedy} algorithm provides a Bayesian Price of Anarchy of 2, and for thecomplete information version of the game we give an algorithm that computes aNash equilibrium strategy profile in $O(n^2 \log^2 m)$ time. Our primaryalgorithmic result shows that an extension of the mechanism to $k$ rounds has aPrice of Anarchy of $1 + \frac{1}{k}$, yielding a graceful tradeoff betweencommunication complexity and the social welfare.

Computing the obstacle number of a plane graph

  An obstacle representation of a plane graph G is V(G) together with a set ofopaque polygonal obstacles such that G is the visibility graph on V(G)determined by the obstacles. We investigate the problem of computing anobstacle representation of a plane graph (ORPG) with a minimum number ofobstacles. We call this minimum size the obstacle number of G.  First, we show that ORPG is NP-hard by reduction from planar vertex cover,resolving a question posed by [8]. Second, we give a reduction from ORPG tomaximum degree 3 planar vertex cover. Since this reduction preserves solutionvalues, it follows that ORPG is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) and admits apolynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS).

Evader Interdiction and Collateral Damage

  In network interdiction problems, evaders (e.g., hostile agents or datapackets) may be moving through a network towards targets and we wish to chooselocations for sensors in order to intercept the evaders before they reach theirdestinations. The evaders might follow deterministic routes or Markov chains,or they may be reactive}, i.e., able to change their routes in order to avoidsensors placed to detect them. The challenge in such problems is to choosesensor locations economically, balancing security gains with costs, includingthe inconvenience sensors inflict upon innocent travelers. We study theobjectives of 1) maximizing the number of evaders captured when limited by abudget on sensing cost and 2) capturing all evaders as cheaply as possible. Wegive optimal sensor placement algorithms for several classes of special graphsand hardness and approximation results for general graphs, including fordeterministic or Markov chain-based and reactive or oblivious evaders. In asimilar-sounding but fundamentally different problem setting posed byRubinstein and Glazer where both evaders and innocent travelers are reactive,we again give optimal algorithms for special cases and hardness andapproximation results on general graphs.

Computing Traversal Times on Dynamic Markovian Paths

  In source routing, a complete path is chosen for a packet to travel fromsource to destination. While computing the time to traverse such a path may bestraightforward in a fixed, static graph, doing so becomes much morechallenging in dynamic graphs, in which the state of an edge in one time slot(i.e., its presence or absence) is random, and may depend on its state in theprevious time step. The traversal time is due to both time spent waiting foredges to appear and time spent crossing them once they become available. Wecompute the expected traversal time (ETT) for a dynamic path in a number ofspecial cases of stochastic edge dynamics models, and for three edge failuremodels, culminating in a surprisingly challenging yet realistic setting inwhich the initial configuration of edge states for the entire path is known. Weshow that the ETT for this "initial configuration" setting can be computed inquadratic time, by an algorithm based on probability generating functions. Wealso give several linear-time upper and lower bounds on the ETT.

Using Photometry to Probe the Circumstellar Environment of delta Scorpii

  We acquired Johnson BV photometry of the binary Be disk system delta~Scorpiiduring its 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 observing seasons and used it to probethe innermost regions of the disk. We found that several disk building eventshave occurred during this time, resulting in an overall brightening in theV-band and reddening of the system. In addition to these long-term trends, wefound cyclical variability in each observing season on timescales between 60and 100 days. We were able to reproduce the changes in the magnitude and colourof delta Sco using our theoretical models and found that variable mass-lossrates in the range 2.5-7.0x10^{-9} M_{sun}/yr over ~35 days can reproduce theobserved increase in brightness.

High-throughput screening for modulators of cellular contractile force

  When cellular contractile forces are central to pathophysiology, these forcescomprise a logical target of therapy. Nevertheless, existing high-throughputscreens are limited to upstream signaling intermediates with poorly definedrelationship to such a physiological endpoint. Using cellular force as thetarget, here we screened libraries to identify novel drug candidates in thecase of human airway smooth muscle cells in the context of asthma, and also inthe case of Schlemm's canal endothelial cells in the context of glaucoma. Thisapproach identified several drug candidates for both asthma and glaucoma. Weattained rates of 1000 compounds per screening day, thus establishing aforce-based cellular platform for high-throughput drug discovery.

Recurrent switching linear dynamical systems

  Many natural systems, such as neurons firing in the brain or basketball teamstraversing a court, give rise to time series data with complex, nonlineardynamics. We can gain insight into these systems by decomposing the data intosegments that are each explained by simpler dynamic units. Building onswitching linear dynamical systems (SLDS), we present a new model class thatnot only discovers these dynamical units, but also explains how their switchingbehavior depends on observations or continuous latent states. These "recurrent"switching linear dynamical systems provide further insight by discovering theconditions under which each unit is deployed, something that traditional SLDSmodels fail to do. We leverage recent algorithmic advances in approximateinference to make Bayesian inference in these models easy, fast, and scalable.

Correlations Between the WMAP and MAXIMA Cosmic Microwave Background  Anisotropy Maps

  We cross-correlate the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropymaps from the WMAP, MAXIMA-I, and MAXIMA-II experiments. We use thecross-spectrum, which is the spherical harmonic transform of the angulartwo-point correlation function, to quantify the correlation as a function ofangular scale. We find that the three possible pairs of cross-spectra are inclose agreement with each other and with the power spectra of the individualmaps. The probability that there is no correlation between the maps is smallerthan 1 * 10^(-8). We also calculate power spectra for maps made of differencesbetween pairs of maps, and show that they are consistent with no signal. Theresults conclusively show that the three experiments not only display the samestatistical properties of the CMB anisotropy, but also detect the same featureswherever the observed sky areas overlap. We conclude that the contribution ofsystematic errors to these maps is negligible and that MAXIMA and WMAP haveaccurately mapped the cosmic microwave background anisotropy.

Five New Millisecond Pulsars From a Radio Survey of 14 Unidentified  Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Sources

  We have discovered five millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in a survey of 14unidentified Fermi-LAT sources in the southern sky using the Parkes radiotelescope. PSRs J0101-6422, J1514-4946, and J1902-5105 reside in binaries,while PSRs J1658-5324 and J1747-4036 are isolated. Using an ephemeris derivedfrom timing observations of PSR J0101-6422 (P =2.57 ms, DM=12 pc cm-3), we havedetected {\gamma}-ray pulsations and measured its proper motion. Its{\gamma}-ray spectrum (a power law of {\Gamma} = 0.9 with a cutoff at 1.6 GeV)and efficiency are typical of other MSPs, but its radio and {\gamma}-ray lightcurves challenge simple geometric models of emission. The high success rate ofthis survey-enabled by selecting {\gamma}-ray sources based on their detailedspectral characteristics-and other similarly successful searches indicate thata substantial fraction of the local population of MSPs may soon be known.

The Physical Conditions, Metallicity and Metal Abundance Ratios In a  Highly Magnified Galaxy at z = 3.6252

  We present optical and near-IR imaging and spectroscopy of SGASJ105039.6$+$001730, a strongly lensed galaxy at z $=$ 3.6252 magnified by$>$30$\times$, and derive its physical properties. We measure a stellar mass oflog(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) $=$ 9.5 $\pm$ 0.35, star formation rates from [OII]$\lambda$$\lambda$3727 and H-$\beta$ of 55 $\pm$ 20 and 84 $\pm$ 17M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively, an electron density of n$_{e} \leq$10$^{3}$ cm$^{-2}$, an electron temperature of T$_{e} \leq$ 14000 K, and ametallicity of 12+log(O/H) $=$ 8.3 $\pm$ 0.1. The strong CIII]$\lambda$$\lambda$1907,1909 emission and abundance ratios of C, N, O and Siare consistent with well-studied starbursts at z $\sim$ 0 with similarmetallicities. Strong P Cygni lines and He II$\lambda$1640 emission indicate asignificant population of Wolf-Rayet stars, but synthetic spectra of individualpopulations of young, hot stars do not reproduce the observed integrated PCygni absorption features. The rest-frame UV spectral features are indicativeof a young starburst with high ionization, implying either 1) an ionizationparameter significantly higher than suggest by rest-frame optical nebularlines, or 2) differences in one or both of the initial mass function and theproperties of ionizing spectra of massive stars. We argue that the observedfeatures are likely the result of a superposition of star forming regions withdifferent physical properties. These results demonstrate the complexity of starformation on scales smaller than individual galaxies, and highlight theimportance of systematic effects that result from smearing together thesignatures of individual star forming regions within galaxies.

Retired A Stars and Their Companions VI. A Pair of Interacting Exoplanet  Pairs Around the Subgiants 24 Sextanis and HD200964

  We report radial velocity measurements of the G-type subgiants 24 Sextanis(=HD90043) and HD200964. Both are massive, evolved stars that exhibit periodicvariations due to the presence of a pair of Jovian planets. Photometricmonitoring with the T12 0.80m APT at Fairborn Observatory demonstrates bothstars to be constant in brightness to <= 0.002 mag, thus strengthening theplanetary interpretation of the radial velocity variations. 24 Sex b,c haveorbital periods of 453.8 days and 883~days, corresponding to semimajor axes1.333 AU and 2.08 AU, and minimum masses (Msini) 1.99 Mjup and 0.86 Mjup,assuming a stellar mass 1.54 Msun. HD200964 b,c have orbital periods of 613.8days and 825 days, corresponding to semimajor axes 1.601 AU and 1.95 AU, andminimum masses 1.85 Mjup and 0.90 Mjup, assuming M* = 1.44 Msun. We also carryout dynamical simulations to properly account for gravitational interactionsbetween the planets. Most, if not all, of the dynamically stable solutionsinclude crossing orbits, suggesting that each system is locked in a mean motionresonance that prevents close encounters and provides long-term stability. Theplanets in the 24 Sex system likely have a period ratio near 2:1, while theHD200964 system is even more tightly packed with a period ratio close to 4:3.However, we caution that further radial velocity observations and more detaileddynamical modelling will be required to provide definitive and unique orbitalsolutions for both cases, and to determine whether the two systems are trulyresonant.

The NASA-UC Eta-Earth Program: I. A Super-Earth Orbiting HD 7924

  We report the discovery of the first low-mass planet to emerge from theNASA-UC Eta-Earth Program, a super-Earth orbiting the K0 dwarf HD 7924.Keplerian modeling of precise Doppler radial velocities reveals a planet withminimum mass M_P sin i = 9.26 M_Earth in a P = 5.398 d orbit. Based onKeck-HIRES measurements from 2001 to 2008, the planet is robustly detected withan estimated false alarm probability of less than 0.001. Photometricobservations using the Automated Photometric Telescopes at Fairborn Observatoryshow that HD 7924 is photometrically constant over the radial velocity periodto 0.19 mmag, supporting the existence of the planetary companion. No transitswere detected down to a photometric limit of ~0.5 mmag, eliminating transitingplanets with a variety of compositions. HD 7924b is one of only eight planetsknown with M_P sin i < 10 M_Earth and as such is a member of an emerging familyof low-mass planets that together constrain theories of planet formation.

Modeling and Analysis of Time-Varying Graphs

  We live in a world increasingly dominated by networks -- communications,social, information, biological etc. A central attribute of many of thesenetworks is that they are dynamic, that is, they exhibit structural changesover time. While the practice of dynamic networks has proliferated, we lagbehind in the fundamental, mathematical understanding of network dynamism.Existing research on time-varying graphs ranges from preliminary algorithmicstudies (e.g., Ferreira's work on evolving graphs) to analysis of specificproperties such as flooding time in dynamic random graphs. A popular model forstudying dynamic graphs is a sequence of graphs arranged by increasingsnapshots of time. In this paper, we study the fundamental property ofreachability in a time-varying graph over time and characterize the latencywith respect to two metrics, namely store-or-advance latency and cut-throughlatency. Instead of expected value analysis, we concentrate on characterizingthe exact probability distribution of routing latency along a randomlyintermittent path in two popular dynamic random graph models. Using thisanalysis, we characterize the loss of accuracy (in a probabilistic setting)between multiple temporal graph models, ranging from one that preserves all thetemporal ordering information for the purpose of computing temporal graphproperties to one that collapses various snapshots into one graph (an operationcalled smashing), with multiple intermediate variants. We also show how someother traditional graph theoretic properties can be extended to the temporaldomain. Finally, we propose algorithms for controlling the progress of a packetin single-copy adaptive routing schemes in various dynamic random graphs.

Testing Inflation with Large Scale Structure: Connecting Hopes with  Reality

  The statistics of primordial curvature fluctuations are our window into theperiod of inflation, where these fluctuations were generated. To date, thecosmic microwave background has been the dominant source of information aboutthese perturbations. Large scale structure is however from where drasticimprovements should originate. In this paper, we explain the theoreticalmotivations for pursuing such measurements and the challenges that lie ahead.In particular, we discuss and identify theoretical targets regarding themeasurement of primordial non-Gaussianity. We argue that when quantified interms of the local (equilateral) template amplitude $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$($f_{\rm NL}^{\rm eq}$), natural target levels of sensitivity are $\Deltaf_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc, eq.} \simeq 1$. We highlight that such levels are withinreach of future surveys by measuring 2-, 3- and 4-point statistics of thegalaxy spatial distribution. This paper summarizes a workshop held at CITA(University of Toronto) on October 23-24, 2014.

Selfish Knapsack

  We consider a selfish variant of the knapsack problem. In our version, theitems are owned by agents, and each agent can misrepresent the set of items sheowns---either by avoiding reporting some of them (understating), or byreporting additional ones that do not exist (overstating). Each agent'sobjective is to maximize, within the items chosen for inclusion in theknapsack, the total valuation of her own chosen items. The knapsack problem, inthis context, seeks to minimize the worst-case approximation ratio for socialwelfare at equilibrium. We show that a randomized greedy mechanism hasattractive strategic properties: in general, it has a correlated price ofanarchy of $2$ (subject to a mild assumption). For overstating-only agents, itbecomes strategyproof; we also provide a matching lower bound of $2$ on the(worst-case) approximation ratio attainable by randomized strategyproofmechanisms, and show that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism can provideany constant approximation ratio. We also deal with more specializedenvironments. For the case of $2$ understating-only agents, we provide arandomized strategyproof $\frac{5+4\sqrt{2}}{7} \approx 1.522$-approximatemechanism, and a lower bound of $\frac{5\sqrt{5}-9}{2} \approx 1.09$. When allagents but one are honest, we provide a deterministic strategyproof$\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618$-approximate mechanism with a matchinglower bound. Finally, we consider a model where agents can misreport theiritems' properties rather than existence. Specifically, each agent owns a singleitem, whose value-to-size ratio is publicly known, but whose actual value andsize are not. We show that an adaptation of the greedy mechanism isstrategyproof and $2$-approximate, and provide a matching lower bound; we alsoshow that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism can provide a constantapproximation ratio.

Estimating the Spectral Density of Large Implicit Matrices

  Many important problems are characterized by the eigenvalues of a largematrix. For example, the difficulty of many optimization problems, such asthose arising from the fitting of large models in statistics and machinelearning, can be investigated via the spectrum of the Hessian of the empiricalloss function. Network data can be understood via the eigenstructure of a graphLaplacian matrix using spectral graph theory. Quantum simulations and othermany-body problems are often characterized via the eigenvalues of the solutionspace, as are various dynamic systems. However, naive eigenvalue estimation iscomputationally expensive even when the matrix can be represented; in many ofthese situations the matrix is so large as to only be available implicitly viaproducts with vectors. Even worse, one may only have noisy estimates of suchmatrix vector products. In this work, we combine several different techniquesfor randomized estimation and show that it is possible to construct unbiasedestimators to answer a broad class of questions about the spectra of suchimplicit matrices, even in the presence of noise. We validate these methods onlarge-scale problems in which graph theory and random matrix theory provideground truth.

Experimental demonstration of Pauli-frame randomization on a  superconducting qubit

  The realization of quantum computing's promise despite noisy imperfect qubitsrelies, at its core, on the ability to scale cheaply through error correctionand fault-tolerance. While fault-tolerance requires relatively mild assumptionsabout the nature of the errors, the overhead associated with coherent andnon-Markovian errors can be orders of magnitude larger than the overheadassociated with purely stochastic Markovian errors. One proposal, known asPauli frame randomization, addresses this challenge by randomizing the circuitsso that the errors are rendered incoherent, while the computation remainsunaffected. Similarly, randomization can suppress couplings to slow degrees offreedom associated with non-Markovian evolution. Here we demonstrate theimplementation of circuit randomization in a superconducting circuit system,exploiting a flexible programming and control infrastructure to achieve thiswith low effort. We use high-accuracy gate-set tomography to demonstrate thatwithout randomization the natural errors experienced by our experiment havecoherent character, and that with randomization these errors are renderedincoherent. We also demonstrate that randomization suppresses signatures ofnon-Markovianity evolution to statistically insignificant levels. Thisdemonstrates how noise models can be shaped into more benign forms for improvedperformance.

SSGSS: The Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey

  The Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey (SSGSS) provides a new sample of101 star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2 with unprecedented multi-wavelengthcoverage. New mid- to far-infrared spectroscopy from the Spitzer SpaceTelescope is added to a rich suite of previous imaging and spectroscopy,including ROSAT, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, TwoMicron All Sky Survey, and Spitzer/SWIRE. Sample selection ensures an evencoverage of the full range of normal galaxy properties, spanning two orders ofmagnitude in stellar mass, color, and dust attenuation. In this paper wepresent the SSGSS data set, describe the science drivers, and detail the sampleselection, observations, data reduction, and quality assessment. Also in thispaper, we compare the shape of the thermal continuum and the degree of silicateabsorption of these typical, star-forming galaxies to those of starburstgalaxies. We investigate the link between star formation rate, infraredluminosity, and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon luminosity, with a viewto calibrating the latter for spectral energy distribution models inphotometric samples and at high redshift. Last, we take advantage of the 5-40micron spectroscopic and far-infrared photometric coverage of this sample toperform detailed fitting of the Draine et al. dust models, and investigate thelink between dust mass and star formation history and active galactic nucleusproperties.

Chemical Cartography with APOGEE: Multi-element abundance ratios

  We map the trends of elemental abundance ratios across the Galactic disk,spanning R = 3-15 kpc and midplane distance |Z|= 0-2 kpc, for 15 elements in asample of 20,485 stars measured by the SDSS/APOGEE survey (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si,P, S, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). Adopting Mg rather than Fe as ourreference element, and separating stars into two populations based on [Fe/Mg],we find that the median trends of [X/Mg] vs. [Mg/H] in each population arenearly independent of location in the Galaxy. The full multi-elementcartography can be summarized by combining these nearly universal mediansequences with our measured metallicity distribution functions and the relativeproportions of the low-[Fe/Mg] (high-alpha) and high-[Fe/Mg] (low-alpha)populations, which depend strongly on R and |Z|. We interpret the mediansequences with a semi-empirical "2-process" model that describes both the ratioof core collapse and Type Ia supernova contributions to each element and themetallicity dependence of the supernova yields. These observationally inferredtrends can provide strong tests of supernova nucleosynthesis calculations. Ourresults lead to a relatively simple picture of abundance ratio variations inthe Milky Way, in which the trends at any location can be described as the sumof two components with relative contributions that change systematically andsmoothly across the Galaxy. Deviations from this picture and future extensionsto other elements can provide further insights into the physics of stellarnucleosynthesis and unusual events in the Galaxy's history.

The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment: First  Detection of High Velocity Milky Way Bar Stars

  Commissioning observations with the Apache Point Observatory GalacticEvolution Experiment (APOGEE), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III, haveproduced radial velocities (RVs) for ~4700 K/M-giant stars in the Milky Waybulge. These high-resolution (R \sim 22,500), high-S/N (>100 per resolutionelement), near-infrared (1.51-1.70 um; NIR) spectra provide accurate RVs(epsilon_v~0.2 km/s) for the sample of stars in 18 Galactic bulge fieldsspanning -1<l<20 deg, |b|<20 deg, and dec>-32 deg. This represents the largestNIR high-resolution spectroscopic sample of giant stars ever assembled in thisregion of the Galaxy. A cold (sigma_v~30 km/s), high-velocity peak (V_GSR \sim+200 km/s) is found to comprise a significant fraction (~10%) of stars in manyof these fields. These high RVs have not been detected in previous MW surveysand are not expected for a simple, circularly rotating disk. Preliminarydistance estimates rule out an origin from the background Sagittarius tidalstream or a new stream in the MW disk. Comparison to various Galactic modelssuggests that these high RVs are best explained by stars in orbits of theGalactic bar potential, although some observational features remainunexplained.

The Open Cluster Chemical Analysis and Mapping Survey: Local Galactic  Metallicity Gradient with APOGEE using SDSS DR10

  The Open Cluster Chemical Analysis and Mapping (OCCAM) Survey aims to producea comprehensive, uniform, infrared-based dataset for hundreds of open clusters,and constrain key Galactic dynamical and chemical parameters from this sample.This first contribution from the OCCAM survey presents analysis of 141 membersstars in 28 open clusters with high-resolution metallicities derived from alarge uniform sample collected as part of the SDSS-III/Apache Point ObservatoryGalactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). This sample includes the firsthigh-resolution metallicity measurements for 22 open clusters. With thislargest ever uniformly observed sample of open cluster stars we investigate theGalactic disk gradients of both [M/H] and [alpha/M]. We find basically nogradient across this range in [alpha/M], but [M/H] does show a gradient forR_{GC} < 10 kpc and a significant flattening beyond R_{GC} = 10 kpc. Inparticular, whereas fitting a single linear trend yields an [M/H] gradient of-0.09 +/- 0.03$ dex/kpc --- similar to previously measure gradients inside 13kpc --- by independently fitting inside and outside 10 kpc separately we find asignificantly steeper gradient near the Sun (7.9 <= R_{GC} <= 10) thanpreviously found (-0.20 +/- 0.08 dex/kpc) and a nearly flat trend beyond 10 kpc(-0.02 +/- 0.09 dex/kpc).

Sodium and Oxygen Abundances in the Open Cluster NGC 6791 from APOGEE  H-Band Spectroscopy

  The open cluster NGC 6791 is among the oldest, most massive and metal-richopen clusters in the Galaxy. High-resolution $H$-band spectra from the ApachePoint Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) of 11 red giants inNGC 6791 are analyzed for their chemical abundances of iron, oxygen, andsodium. The abundances of these three elements are found to be homogeneous(with abundance dispersions at the level of $\sim$ 0.05 - 0.07 dex) in thesecluster red giants, which span much of the red-giant branch (T$_{\rm eff}$$\sim$ 3500K - 4600K), and include two red-clump giants. From the infraredspectra, this cluster is confirmed to be among the most metal-rich clusters inthe Galaxy ($<$[Fe/H]$>$ = 0.34 $\pm$ 0.06), and is found to have a roughlysolar value of [O/Fe] and slightly enhanced [Na/Fe]. Non-LTE calculations forthe studied Na I lines in the APOGEE spectral region ($\lambda$16373.86\AA\ and$\lambda$16388.85\AA) indicate only small departures from LTE ($\leq$ 0.04 dex)for the parameter range and metallicity of the studied stars. The previouslyreported double population of cluster members with different Na abundances isnot found among the studied sample.

Young alpha-enriched giant stars in the solar neighbourhood

  We derive age constraints for 1639 red giants in the APOKASC sample for whichseismic parameters from Kepler, as well as effective temperatures,metallicities and [alpha/Fe] values from APOGEE DR12 are available. Weinvestigate the relation between age and chemical abundances for these stars,using a simple and robust approach to obtain ages. We first derive stellarmasses using standard seismic scaling relations, then determine the maximumpossible age for each star as function of its mass and metallicity,independently of its evolutionary stage. While the overall trend betweenmaximum age and chemical abundances is a declining fraction of young stars withincreasing [alpha/Fe], at least 14 out of 241 stars with [alpha/Fe]>0.13 areyounger than 6 Gyr. Five stars with [alpha/Fe]>0.2 have ages below 4 Gyr. Weexamine the effect of modifications in the standard seismic scaling relations,as well as the effect of very low helium fractions, but these changes are notenough to make these stars as old as usually expected for alpha-rich stars(i.e., ages greater than 8-9 Gyr). Such unusual alpha-rich young stars havealso been detected by other surveys, but defy simple explanations in a galaxyevolution context.

ASPCAP: The Apogee Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline

  The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) has builtthe largest moderately high-resolution (R=22, 500) spectroscopic map of thestars across the Milky Way, and including dust-obscured areas. The APOGEEStellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) is the softwaredeveloped for the automated analysis of these spectra. ASPCAP determinesatmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from observed spectra bycomparing observed spectra to libraries of theoretical spectra, using chi-2minimization in a multidimensional parameter space. The package consists of afortran90 code that does the actual minimization, and a wrapper IDL code forbook-keeping and data handling. This paper explains in detail the ASPCAPcomponents and functionality, and presents results from a number of testsdesigned to check its performance. ASPCAP provides stellar effectivetemperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities precise to 2%, 0.1 dex, and0.05 dex, respectively, for most APOGEE stars, which are predominantly giants.It also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levelsof precision, typically under 0.1 dex. The final data release (DR12) of theSloan Digital Sky Survey III contains an APOGEE database of more than 150,000stars. ASPCAP development continues in the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey.

Enabling New ALMA Science with Improved Support for Time-Domain  Observations

  While the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is a uniquelypowerful telescope, its impact in certain fields of astrophysics has beenlimited by observatory policies rather than the telescope's innate technicalcapabilities. In particular, several observatory policies present challengesfor observations of variable, mobile, and/or transient sources --- collectivelyreferred to here as "time-domain" observations. In this whitepaper we identifysome of these policies, describe the scientific applications they impair, andsuggest changes that would increase ALMA's science impact in Cycle 6 andbeyond.  Parties interested in time-domain science with ALMA are encouraged to jointhe ALMA Time-domain Special Interest Group (ATSIG) by signing up for the ATSIGmailing list at https://groups.google.com/group/alma-td-sig .

Excess Optical Enhancement Observed with ARCONS for Early Crab Giant  Pulses

  We observe an extraordinary link in the Crab pulsar between the enhancementof an optical pulse and the timing of the corresponding giant radio pulse. Atoptical through infrared wavelengths, our observations use the high timeresolution of ARCONS, a unique superconducting energy-resolving photon-countingarray at the Palomar 200-inch telescope. At radio wavelengths, we observe withthe Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope and the GUPPI backend. We see an$11.3\pm2.5\%$ increase in peak optical flux for pulses that have anaccompanying giant radio pulse arriving near the peak of the optical mainpulse, in contrast to a $3.2\pm0.5\%$ increase when an accompanying giant radiopulse arrives soon after the optical peak. We also observe that the peak of theoptical main pulse is $2.8\pm0.8\%$ enhanced when there is a giant radio pulseaccompanying the optical interpulse. We observe no statistically significantspectral differences between optical pulses accompanied by and not accompaniedby giant radio pulses. Our results extend previous observations ofoptical-radio correlation to the time and spectral domains. Our refinedtemporal correlation suggests that optical and radio emission are indeedcausally linked, and the lack of spectral differences suggests that the samemechanism is responsible for all optical emission.

Kepler Flares II: The Temporal Morphology of White-Light Flares on GJ  1243

  We present the largest sample of flares ever compiled for a single M dwarf,the active M4 star GJ 1243. Over 6100 individual flare events, with energiesranging from $10^{29}$ to $10^{33}$ erg, are found in 11 months of 1-minutecadence data from Kepler. This sample is unique for its completeness anddynamic range. We have developed automated tools for finding flares inshort-cadence Kepler light curves, and performed extensive validation andclassification of the sample by eye. From this pristine sample of flares wegenerate a median flare template. This template shows that two exponentialcooling phases are present during the white-light flare decay, providingfundamental constraints for models of flare physics. The template is also usedas a basis function to decompose complex multi-peaked flares, allowing us tostudy the energy distribution of these events. Only a small number of flareevents are not well fit by our template. We find that complex, multi-peakedflares occur in over 80% of flares with a duration of 50 minutes or greater.The underlying distribution of flare durations for events 10 minutes and longerappears to follow a broken power law. Our results support the idea thatsympathetic flaring may be responsible for some complex flare events.

Rapid Rotation of Low-Mass Red Giants Using APOKASC: A Measure of  Interaction Rates on the Post-main-sequence

  We investigate the occurrence rate of rapidly rotating ($v\sin i$$>$10 kms$^{-1}$), low-mass giant stars in the APOGEE-Kepler (APOKASC) fields withasteroseismic mass and surface gravity measurements. Such stars are likelymerger products and their frequency places interesting constraints on stellarpopulation models. We also identify anomalous rotators, i.e. stars with 5 kms$^{-1}$$<$$v\sin i$$<$10 km s$^{-1}$ that are rotating significantly fasterthan both angular momentum evolution predictions and the measured rates ofsimilar stars. Our data set contains fewer rapid rotators than one would expectgiven measurements of the Galactic field star population, which likelyindicates that asteroseismic detections are less common in rapidly rotating redgiants. The number of low-mass moderate (5-10 km s$^{-1}$) rotators in oursample gives a lower limit of 7% for the rate at which low-mass stars interacton the upper red giant branch because single stars in this mass range areexpected to rotate slowly. Finally, we classify the likely origin of the rapidor anomalous rotation where possible. KIC 10293335 is identified as a mergerproduct and KIC 6501237 is a possible binary system of two oscillating redgiants.

Chemical abundance gradients from open clusters in the Milky Way disk:  results from the APOGEE survey

  Metallicity gradients provide strong constraints for understanding thechemical evolution of the Galaxy. We report on radial abundance gradients ofFe, Ni, Ca, Si, and Mg obtained from a sample of 304 red-giant members of 29disk open clusters, mostly concentrated at galactocentric distances between ~8- 15 kpc, but including two open clusters in the outer disk. The observationsare from the APOGEE survey. The chemical abundances were derived automaticallyby the ASPCAP pipeline and these are part of the SDSS III Data Release 12. Thegradients, obtained from least squares fits to the data, are relatively flat,with slopes ranging from -0.026 to -0.033 dex/kpc for the alpha-elements [O/H],[Ca/H], [Si/H] and [Mg/H] and -0.035 dex/kpc and -0.040 dex/kpc for [Fe/H] and[Ni/H], respectively. Our results are not at odds with the possibility thatmetallicity ([Fe/H]) gradients are steeper in the inner disk (R_GC ~7 - 12 kpc)and flatter towards the outer disk. The open cluster sample studied spans asignificant range in age. When breaking the sample into age bins, there is someindication that the younger open cluster population in our sample (log age <8.7) has a flatter metallicity gradient when compared with the gradientsobtained from older open clusters.

The roAp star $α$ Circini as seen by BRITE-Constellation

  We report on an analysis of high-precision, multi-colour photometricobservations of the rapidly-oscillating Ap (roAp) star $\alpha$ Cir. Theseobservations were obtained with the BRITE-Constellation, which is a coordinatedmission of five nanosatellites that collects continuousmillimagnitude-precision photometry of dozens of bright stars for up to 180days at a time in two colours (Johnson B and R). BRITE stands for BRight TargetExplorer. The object $\alpha$ Cir is the brightest roAp star and an idealtarget for such investigations, facilitating the determination of oscillationfrequencies with high resolution. This star is bright enough for complementaryinterferometry and time-resolved spectroscopy. Four BRITE satellites observed$\alpha$ Cir for 146 d or 33 rotational cycles. Phasing the photometryaccording to the 4.4790 d rotational period reveals qualitatively differentlight variations in the two photometric bands. The phased red-band photometryis in good agreement with previously-published WIRE data, showing a light curvesymmetric about phase 0.5 with a strong contribution from the first harmonic.The phased blue-band data, in contrast, show an essentially sinusoidalvariation. We model both light curves with Bayesian Photometric Imaging, whichsuggests the presence of two large-scale, photometrically bright (relative tothe surrounding photosphere) spots. We also examine the high-frequencypulsation spectrum as encoded in the BRITE photometry. Our analysis establishesthe stability of the main pulsation frequency over the last 20 years, confirmsthe presence of frequency f7, which was not detected (or the mode not excited)prior to 2006, and excludes quadrupolar modes for the main pulsation frequency.

RELICS: Strong-lensing analysis of the massive clusters MACS  J0308.9+2645 and PLCK G171.9-40.7

  Strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters has become a powerful toolfor probing the high-redshift Universe, magnifying distant and faint backgroundgalaxies. Reliable strong lensing (SL) models are crucial for determining theintrinsic properties of distant, magnified sources and for constructing theirluminosity function. We present here the first SL analysis of MACS J0308.9+2645and PLCK G171.9-40.7, two massive galaxy clusters imaged with the Hubble SpaceTelescope in the framework of the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS).We use the Light-Traces-Mass modeling technique to uncover sets of multiplyimaged galaxies and constrain the mass distribution of the clusters. Our SLanalysis reveals that both clusters have particularly large Einstein radii($\theta_E>30"$ for a source redshift of $z_s=2$), providing fairly large areaswith high magnifications, useful for high-redshift galaxy searches ($\sim2$arcmin$^{2}$ with $\mu>5$ to $\sim1$ arcmin$^{2}$ with $\mu>10$, similar to atypical \textit{Hubble Frontier Fields} cluster). We also find that MACSJ0308.9+2645 hosts a promising, apparently bright (J$\sim23.2-24.6$ AB),multiply imaged high-redshift candidate at $z\sim6.4$. These images are amongstthe brightest high-redshift candidates found in RELICS. Our mass models,including magnification maps, are made publicly available for the communitythrough the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

RELICS: A Strong Lens Model for SPT-CLJ0615-5746, a z=0.972 Cluster

  We present a lens model for the cluster SPT-CLJ0615$-$5746, which is thehighest redshift ($z=0.972$) system in the Reionization of Lensing ClustersSurvey (RELICS), making it the highest redshift cluster for which a full stronglens model is published. We identify three systems of multiply-imaged lensedgalaxies, two of which we spectroscopically confirm at $z=1.358$ and $z=4.013$,which we use as constraints for the model. We find a foreground structure at$z\sim0.4$, which we include as a second cluster-sized halo in one of ourmodels; however two different statistical tests find the best-fit modelconsists of one cluster-sized halo combined with three individually optimizedgalaxy-sized halos, as well as contributions from the cluster galaxiesthemselves. We find the total projected mass density within $r=26.7"$ (theregion where the strong lensing constraints exist) to be$M=2.51^{+0.15}_{-0.09}\times 10^{14}$~M$_{\odot}$. If we extrapolate out to$r_{500}$, our projected mass density is consistent with the mass inferred fromweak lensing and from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect($M\sim10^{15}$~M$_{\odot}$). This cluster is lensing a previously reported$z\sim10$ galaxy, which, if spectroscopically confirmed, will be thehighest-redshift strongly lensed galaxy known.

RELICS: High-Resolution Constraints on the Inner Mass Distribution of  the z=0.83 Merging Cluster RXJ0152.7-1357 from strong lensing

  Strong gravitational lensing (SL) is a powerful means to map the distributionof dark matter. In this work, we perform a SL analysis of the prominent X-raycluster RXJ0152.7-1357 (z=0.83, also known as CL 0152.7-1357) in \textit{HubbleSpace Telescope} images, taken in the framework of the Reionization LensingCluster Survey (RELICS). On top of a previously known $z=3.93$ galaxy multiplyimaged by RXJ0152.7-1357, for which we identify an additional multiple image,guided by a light-traces-mass approach we identify seven new sets of multiplyimaged background sources lensed by this cluster, spanning the redshift range[1.79-3.93]. A total of 25 multiple images are seen over a small area of ~0.4$arcmin^2$, allowing us to put relatively high-resolution constraints on theinner matter distribution. Although modestly massive, the high degree ofsubstructure together with its very elongated shape make RXJ0152.7-1357 a veryefficient lens for its size. This cluster also comprises the third-largestsample of z~6-7 candidates in the RELICS survey. Finally, we present acomparison of our resulting mass distribution and magnification estimates withthose from a Lenstool model. These models are made publicly available throughthe MAST archive.

Wide-Orbit Exoplanet Demographics

  The Kepler, K2 and TESS transit surveys are revolutionizing our understandingof planets orbiting close to their host stars and our understanding ofexoplanet systems in general, but there remains a gap in our understanding ofwide-orbit planets. This gap in our understanding must be filled if we are tounderstand planet formation and how it affects exoplanet habitability. Wesummarize current and planned exoplanet detection programs using a variety ofmethods: microlensing (including WFIRST), radial velocities, Gaia astrometry,and direct imaging. Finally, we discuss the prospects for joint analyses usingresults from multiple methods and obstacles that could hinder such analyses.  We endorse the findings and recommendations published in the 2018 NationalAcademy report on Exoplanet Science Strategy. This white paper extends andcomplements the material presented therein.

An RF-only ion-funnel for extraction from high-pressure gases

  An RF ion-funnel technique has been developed to extract ions from ahigh-pressure (10 bar) noble-gas environment into vacuum ($10^{-6}$ mbar).Detailed simulations have been performed and a prototype has been developed forthe purpose of extracting $^{136}$Ba ions from Xe gas with high efficiency.With this prototype, ions have been extracted for the first time fromhigh-pressure xenon gas and argon gas. Systematic studies have been carried outand compared to the simulations. This demonstration of extraction of ions withmass comparable to that of the gas generating the high-pressure into vacuum hasapplications to Ba tagging from a Xe-gas time-projection chamber (TPC) fordouble beta decay as well as to the general problem of recovering trace amountsof an ionized element in a heavy (m$>40$ u) carrier gas.

The Size, Shape, and Scattering of Sagittarius A* at 86 GHz: First VLBI  with ALMA

  The Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is one ofthe most promising targets to study the dynamics of black hole accretion andoutflow via direct imaging with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). At3.5 mm (86 GHz), the emission from Sgr A* is resolvable with the GlobalMillimeter VLBI Array (GMVA). We present the first observations of Sgr A* withthe phased Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) joining theGMVA. Our observations achieve an angular resolution of ~87{\mu}as, improvingupon previous experiments by a factor of two. We reconstruct a first image ofthe unscattered source structure of Sgr A* at 3.5 mm, mitigating effects ofinterstellar scattering. The unscattered source has a major axis size of 120$\pm$ 34{\mu}as (12 $\pm$ 3.4 Schwarzschild radii), and a symmetricalmorphology (axial ratio of 1.2$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$), which is further supported byclosure phases consistent with zero within 3{\sigma}. We show that multipledisk-dominated models of Sgr A* match our observational constraints, while thetwo jet-dominated models considered are constrained to small viewing angles.Our long-baseline detections to ALMA also provide new constraints on thescattering of Sgr A*, and we show that refractive scattering effects are likelyto be weak for images of Sgr A* at 1.3 mm with the Event Horizon Telescope. Ourresults provide the most stringent constraints to date for the intrinsicmorphology and refractive scattering of Sgr A*, demonstrating the exceptionalcontribution of ALMA to millimeter VLBI.

KELT-19Ab: A P~4.6 Day Hot Jupiter Transiting a Likely Am Star with a  Distant Stellar Companion

  We present the discovery of the giant planet KELT-19Ab, which transits themoderately bright $(\mathrm{V} \sim 9.9)$ A8V star TYC 764-1494-1 with anorbital period of 4.61 days. We confirm the planetary nature of the companionvia a combination of radial velocities, which limit the mass to $<4.1\,\mathrm{M_J}$ $(3\sigma)$, and a clear Doppler tomography signal, whichindicates a retrograde projected spin-orbit misalignment of $\lambda =-179.7^{+3.7}_{-3.8}$ degrees. Global modeling indicates that the $\rm{T_{eff}}=7500 \pm 110\,\mathrm{K}$ host star has $\mathrm{M_*} =1.62^{+0.25}_{-0.20}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\mathrm{R_*} = 1.83 \pm0.10\,\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The planet has a radius of $\mathrm{R_P}=1.91 \pm0.11\,\mathrm{R_J}$ and receives a stellar insolation flux of $\sim 3.2\times10^{9}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, leading to an inferred equilibriumtemperature of $\rm{T_{EQ}} = \sim 1935\,\rm{K}$ assuming zero albedo andcomplete heat redistribution. With a $v\sin{I_*}=84.8\pm2.0\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the host is relatively slowly rotating compared toother stars with similar effective temperatures, and it appears to be enhancedin metallic elements but deficient in calcium, suggesting that it is likely anAm star. KELT-19A would be the first detection of an Am host of a transitingplanet of which we are aware. Adaptive optics observations of the system revealthe existence of a companion with late G9V/early K1V spectral type at aprojected separation of $\approx 160\,\mathrm{AU}$. Radial velocitymeasurements indicate that this companion is bound. Most Am stars are known tohave stellar companions, which are often invoked to explain the relatively slowrotation of the primary. In this case, the stellar companion is unlikely tohave caused the tidal braking of the primary. However, it may have emplaced thetransiting planetary companion via the Kozai-Lidov mechanism.

KELT-22Ab: A Massive Hot Jupiter Transiting a Near Solar Twin

  We present the discovery of KELT-22Ab, a hot Jupiter from the KELT-Southsurvey. KELT-22Ab transits the moderately bright ($V\sim 11.1$) Sun-like G2Vstar TYC 7518-468-1. The planet has an orbital period of $P = 1.3866529 \pm0.0000027 $ days, a radius of $R_{P} = 1.285_{-0.071}^{+0.12}~R_{J}$, and arelatively large mass of $M_{P} = 3.47_{-0.14}^{+0.15}~ M_{J}$. The star has$R_{\star} = 1.099_{-0.046}^{+0.079}~ R_{\odot}$, $M_{\star} =1.092_{-0.041}^{+0.045}~ M_{\odot}$, ${T_{\rm eff}\,} = 5767_{-49}^{+50}~$ K,${\log{g_\star}} = 4.393_{-0.060}^{+0.039}~$ (cgs), and [m/H] =$+0.259_{-0.083}^{+0.085}~$, and thus, other than its slightly super-solarmetallicity, appears to be a near solar twin. Surprisingly, KELT-22A exhibitskinematics and a Galactic orbit that are somewhat atypical for thin disk stars.Nevertheless, the star is rotating quite rapidly for its estimated age, showsevidence of chromospheric activity, and is somewhat metal rich. Imaging revealsa slightly fainter companion to KELT-22A that is likely bound, with a projectedseparation of 6\arcsec ($\sim$1400 AU). In addition to the orbital motioncaused by the transiting planet, we detect a possible linear trend in theradial velocity of KELT-22A suggesting the presence of another relativelynearby body that is perhaps non-stellar. KELT-22Ab is highly irradiated (as aconsequence of the small semi-major axis of $a/R_{\star} = 4.97$), and ismildly inflated. At such small separations, tidal forces become significant.The configuration of this system is optimal for measuring the rate of tidaldissipation within the host star. Our models predict that, due to tidal forces,the semi-major axis of KELT-22Ab is decreasing rapidly, and is thus predictedto spiral into the star within the next Gyr.

Very Metal-poor Stars in the Outer Galactic Bulge Found by the Apogee  Survey

  Despite its importance for understanding the nature of early stellargenerations and for constraining Galactic bulge formation models, at presentlittle is known about the metal-poor stellar content of the central Milky Way.This is a consequence of the great distances involved and intervening dustobscuration, which challenge optical studies. However, the Apache PointObservatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), a wide-area, multifiber,high-resolution spectroscopic survey within Sloan Digital Sky Survey III(SDSS-III), is exploring the chemistry of all Galactic stellar populations atinfrared wavelengths, with particular emphasis on the disk and the bulge. Anautomated spectral analysis of data on 2,403 giant stars in twelve fields inthe bulge obtained during APOGEE commissioning yielded five stars with lowmetallicity([Fe/H]$\le-1.7$), including two that are very metal-poor[Fe/H]$\sim-2.1$ by bulge standards.  Luminosity-based distance estimates place the five stars within the outerbulge, where other 1,246 of the analyzed stars may reside. A manual reanalysisof the spectra verifies the low metallicities, and finds these stars to beenhanced in the $\alpha$-elements O, Mg, and Si without significant$\alpha$-pattern differences with other local halo or metal-weak thick-diskstars of similar metallicity, or even with other more metal-rich bulge stars.While neither the kinematics nor chemistry of these stars can yet definitivelydetermine which, if any, are truly bulge members, rather than denizens of otherpopulations co-located with the bulge, the newly-identified stars reveal thatthe chemistry of metal-poor stars in the central Galaxy resembles that ofmetal-weak thick-disk stars at similar metallicity.
