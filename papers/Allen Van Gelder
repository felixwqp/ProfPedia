The QBF Gallery: Behind the Scenes

  Over the last few years, much progress has been made in the theory and
practice of solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Novel solvers have been
presented that either successfully enhance established techniques or implement
novel solving paradigms. Powerful preprocessors have been realized that tune
the encoding of a formula to make it easier to solve. Frameworks for
certification and solution extraction emerged that allow for a detailed
interpretation of a QBF solver's results, and new types of QBF encodings were
presented for various application problems.
  To capture these developments the QBF Gallery was established in 2013. The
QBF Gallery aims at providing a forum to assess QBF tools and to collect new,
expressive benchmarks that allow for documenting the status quo and that
indicate promising research directions. These benchmarks became the basis for
the experiments conducted in the context of the QBF Gallery 2013 and follow-up
evaluations. In this paper, we report on the setup of the QBF Gallery. To this
end, we conducted numerous experiments which allowed us not only to assess the
quality of the tools, but also the quality of the benchmarks.
