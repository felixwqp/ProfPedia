Deriving Verb Predicates By Clustering Verbs with Arguments

  Hand-built verb clusters such as the widely used Levin classes (Levin, 1993)
have proved useful, but have limited coverage. Verb classes automatically
induced from corpus data such as those from VerbKB (Wijaya, 2016), on the other
hand, can give clusters with much larger coverage, and can be adapted to
specific corpora such as Twitter. We present a method for clustering the
outputs of VerbKB: verbs with their multiple argument types, e.g.
"marry(person, person)", "feel(person, emotion)." We make use of a novel
low-dimensional embedding of verbs and their arguments to produce high quality
clusters in which the same verb can be in different clusters depending on its
argument type. The resulting verb clusters do a better job than hand-built
clusters of predicting sarcasm, sentiment, and locus of control in tweets.
